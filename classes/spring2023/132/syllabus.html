<h2>Course Logistics</h2>
<p>

<u>Lecture </u><br>
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday  3:10 PM - 4:00 PM <br>
Location: Norm Asbjornson Hall 165 <br>

<br>

<u> Lab </u> <BR>
Lab time depends on the section that you registered for: <br>
<ul>
    <li>Section 002- Tuesdays 8:00 - 9:50 AM </li>
    <li>Section 003- Tuesdays 10:00 - 11:50 AM </li>
    <li>Section 004- Tuesdays 12:00 - 2:00 PM </li>
    <li>Section 005- Tuesdays 2:10 - 4:00 PM </li>
    <li>Section 006- Tuesdays 4:10 - 6:00 PM </li>
</ul>
Location: Roberts Hall 111
<br>

<br>
Q: Is lab attendance mandatory? <br>
A: I highly encourage you to go to lab, but attendance will never be taken. Lab assignments are posted before Tuesday, and can be completed from home. <br>

<br>

Q: Do I have to attend the lab section that I registered for? <br>
A: To avoid overcrowding a certain lab time, please do try to attend the lab section that you registered for. If you have a legitimate reason to attend another lab section, or need to attend a different lab section a few times during the semester, that's fine. <br>

<br>
Q: Do I have to bring my own laptop to lab? <br>
A: I would recommend doing so, but Roberts 111 is a computer lab and has all the software and tools for you to complete the lab if you do not have a laptop. <br>

<h2>Textbook</h2>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Java-6th-ebook/dp/B00JDRQF8C">Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, 6th Edition by Goodrich, Tamassia, and Goldwasser</a></li>
  
  <br>
  
  <li> This textbook is not required, but I would recommend it if you are truly trying to get the most out of this course. </li>
 
</ul>

<h2> Supplemental Zybook Text</h2>
<p> Zybook is a digital, interactive textbook that students may find more valueable than a traditional physical textbook.</p>
<ul>
    <li> Programming in Java ZyBook</li>
    <li> Data Structures and Algorithms (Java) ZyBook</li>
</ul>

<h2> Other Required Materials</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Java JDK</li>
  <li> Java IDE</li>
  <ul>
        <li> IntelliJ</li>
        <li> Eclipse</li>
        <li> Netbeans</li> 
  </ul>
  I will be using and recommending IntelliJ in this class, but you can use any of the IDEs above. IntelliJ is free (must register for a student license with your MSU email)

</ul>

<h2> Class Communication </h2>
<ul>
	<li> <a href="">Discord server link</a></li>
  <li>I will be using Discord to make announcements, answer any questions, discuss course material, and help debug issues. Please do not overshare answers or solutions in the public channels</li>
  <li>I am literally always on Discord, so you always shoot me a DM whenever. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Other Resources</h2>

<ul>
	<li> <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/#JavaSE">Official Java Documentation</a> </li>
	<li> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/">Geeksforgeeks Java Tutorials </a></li>

<h2>Catalog Description</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Credits: 3</li>
  <br>
  <li>Prerequisite: CSCI 127- Joy and Beauty of Data (Required)</li>
  <li>Prerequisite: M 151Q- Precalculus (Required</li>

  <br>
  <li>Description:  An examination of advanced Java and basic data structures and their application in problem solving. Data structures include stacks, queues and lists. An introduction to algorithms employing the data structures to solve various problems including searching and sorting, and recursion. Understanding and using Java class libraries. The laboratory uses Java. Introduces Big-O Notation</li>
</ul>
<p> <b> Note from Reese: </b> The prerequisite list is pretty beefy, but I will cover all the relevant background information from those classes during before starting each section. We will be tinkering around with memory (stack and heap, processes, etc) and working very closely with C programs. If you have not taken C programming,  I would highly recommend withdrawing and taking this class at a later time. Please email or chat with me if you have any concerns about prereqs for this course</p>

<h2>Course Outcomes</h2>

<h2>Grading</h2>



40% - Labs (12 @ ~3% each) (I will drop your lowest lab grade)  <br>
40% - Programs

10% - Final Exam <br>

<h2> Grading Breakdown </h2>

<ul>
    <li> Labs </li>
    <li> Programs </li>
    <li> Midterm </li> 
    <li> Final Exam </li>
</ul>

<b>Rubber Duck Extra Credit (1%)- </b> 

<h2>Grading Scale</h2>

  <li>87+: B+</li>
  <li>83+: B</li>
  <li>80+: B-</li>

</ul>

Q: Do you curve exams or final grades? <br>
A: Maybe, but probably not. If exams or final grades are lower than I anticipated, then I may apply a curve. For final grades, if you are within 1% of the next letter grade, I will bump you up.


<h2> Late Assignment Policy </h2>
 
<ul>
	<li> < 24 hours: 25% </li>
	<li> < 48 Hours 50% </li>
	<li> > 48 hours: no credit. </li>

<h2> Getting Help and Succeeding </h2>




<h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>

<p>
  All students should read the 
  <a href="http://www2.montana.edu/policy/student_conduct/">MSU
  Student Conduct Code</a>.
</p>
<p> All labs will be individual submissions. </p>


<p>
  When it comes to labs, you <i> may </i> 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share ideas with other students in the class.</li>
  <li> Work together on labs in the same physical location. </li>
  <li>Help other students troubleshoot problems.</li>
  <li>Give hints or provide textbook page numbers/slide numbers to students seeking help</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You may <i>NOT</i>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share your code and solutions with other students.</li>
  <li>Submit solutions that you did not write.</li>
  <li>Modify another student's solution and claim it as your own.</li>
  <li>Share your report or solutions directly on Discord </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Failure to abide by these rules will result in an "F"
  for the course and being reported to the Dean of Students.
</p>

<h2> Plagiarism </h2>
<p> You may not copy or modify solutions that are not your own (e.g. from the Internet, classmate, ...) for any graded material. Copying and pasting very small snippets of code is acceptable, however copying/pasting or stealing entire solutions from an external source is prohibited. I know how to use the Google and I have a Chegg membership, so If you find something, I will too! It is easy for me to tell if you copy and pasted code from the Internet, so please do not engage in such academic misconduct. If I find a student engaging in plagiarism, I will have to report you to the Dean of Students. </p>
