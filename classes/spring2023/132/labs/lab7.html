<h1>Lab 7:  Big-O Runtime Analysis</h1>


<h2>Due Date and Submission Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Due Date: Tuesday, March 21st at 11:59 p.m.</li>
  <li>Partner Information: This is an individual assignment. You are allowed to collaborate with other students, but each student must submit their individual, independent solution.</li> 
  <li> Submission Instructions: You will not be submitting any code for this assignment. You will submit your solution as a pdf to the appropriate D2L dropbox. </li>

</ul>

<hr />

<h2>The goal of this lab is:</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Gain experience analyzing the running time of different algorithms</li>
  <li> Use Big-O notation to describe the running time of an algorithm</li>
</ul>

<hr />


<h3>Directions </h3>

    You will determine the running time of three different algorithms in this lab. For each operation/line of code in the algorithm, you must find the time complexity/running time of that operation (just like we did in class and on the midterm exam). Then you must state the 
    total running time of the algorithm <b>using Big O notation</b>. In your final answer, you should drop all non-dominant factors and multiplicative factors. <b> If you say something is O(n) or O(n^2), make sure you state what n is </b>

    <br><br>

    You can print out the lab instructions below and fill our your solution by hand and scan it as a pdf, or you can fill it out digitally (pdf editor, word, document editor) and submit it as a pdf.
