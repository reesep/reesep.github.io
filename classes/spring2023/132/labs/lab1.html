<h1>Lab 1: Name Tag Java Program</h1>


<h2>Due Date and Submission Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Due Date: Tuesday, January 24th at 11:59 p.m.</li>
  <li>Partner Information: This is an individual assignment. You are allowed to collaborate with other students, but each student must submit their individual, independent solution.</li> 
  <li> Submission Instructions: Upload your solution (.java file), entitled <b>Lab1.java</b> to the BrightSpace(D2L) Lab 1 Dropbox. </li>

</ul>

<hr />

<h2>The goal of this lab is:</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Use Eclipse (or another IDE) to create a basic Java class  </li>
  <li> Print out information to the screen using <tt>System.out.println()</tt> </li>
  <li> Run Java code and see output in the console </li> 
</ul>

<h3>Background and Directions </h3>

<p>
	The career fair is approaching! You will write a program that will a print out a simple name tag for you. Your name tag will consist of 1. Your name, 2. Your Class (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior), 3. Your major, and 4. Expected graduation date (you can make this up if you don't know this yet). 
	
</p>

<p>
	
    You will create a Java class, named Lab1.java (make sure you check the box for <tt>public static void main(String[] args)</tt> when you create your class). In your java class, your name tag will be printed to the screen using a series of <tt>System.out.println()</tt> statements. Here is an example name tag:

    <pre>
        +------------------------------------------------+
        |           Name: Reese Pearsall                 |
        |                                                |
        |           Class: Sophomore                     |
        |                                                |
        |           Major: Computer Science              |
        |                                                |
        | Expected Graduation: Spring 2026               |
        +------------------------------------------------+
    </pre>
        
</p>	

<h3> Required Output </h3>
<p> When your program is run, your name tag should get printed out to the screen. It should look very similar to the output seen in <a href="lab1_output.PNG"> in this screenshot </a> (obviously your name tag will have your information). 



</pre>
<h3>Grading (10 points) </h3>


<ul>
  <li>8 points - Your program prints out a name tag that has your name, class, major, and expected graduation.</li> 
  <li>1 points - Your name tag information appears in a "text box" as seen in the sample output </li> 
  <li>1 point - Your Java class is named correctly (Lab1.Java)</li>
</ul>
