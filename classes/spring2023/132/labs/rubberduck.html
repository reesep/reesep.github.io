<h1>Rubber Duck Extra Credit</h1>


<h2>Due Date and Submission Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Due Date: Friday, May 5th  at 11:59 p.m.</li>
</ul>






<h3>Directions </h3>

    To verify that your duck is still alive, you will submit a picture of your duck posing with something that has your name on it. That will help tell me that it's <i>your duck</i> and not a screenshot you stole from the internet. Submit your picture to the D2L dropbox, and you will receive 1% extra credit to your final grade!
