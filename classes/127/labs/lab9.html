<li>Partner Information:You may complete this assignment individually or with exactly one partner.</li> 
  <li> Submission Instructions (working alone): Upload your solution (.py file), entitled <b>YourFirstName-YourLastName-Lab9.py</b> to the BrightSpace(D2L) Lab 9 Dropbox. </li>
   <li> Submission Instructions (working with a partner): Upload your solution (.py file), entitled <b>YourFirstName-YourLastName-PartnerFirstName-PartnerLastName-Lab9.py</b> to the BrightSpace(D2L) Lab 9 Dropbox. </li>   
  <li>Deadline Reminder: Late passes can be used on this assignment. However, if you do not use a late pass and submit it past the deadline, you submission will lose some points (see late assignment policy). After 48 hours,

</ul>

<h2>In order to complete this lab, you will need to understand</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Numpy Arrays </li>
	<li> Matplotlib </li>
	<li> Object Oriented Programming </li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>In a modified game of Yahtzee, five eight-sided dice are rolled once.</li>
<li>For this assignment, you will simulate this modified game
    of Yahtzee to determine how likely certain outcomes are.</li>
<li>In this modified version of Yahtzee, a <b>Low Roll</b> occurs
    when each of the five dice is either a 1 or an 2.
    For example, 1-1-1-1-1 or 2-2-1-2-1.</li>
<li>In this modified version of Yahtzee, a <b>Three of a Kind</b> occurs
    when three of the dice show the same number.  
    The other two dice must not show this number
    and must also be different from one another.  
    For example, 4-7-4-4-2 but not 4-7-4-4-7.</li>
<li>In this modified version of Yahtzee, a <b>large straight</b> occurs
    when the five numbers can be arranged consecutively 
    (for example, 1-3-4-2-5 or 5-7-4-6-3).  Hint: the numpy library
    contains a sort function.</li> 
</ul>


<h2>Part 1: Numpy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="lab9.txt">lab11.py</a>, rename it according to 
    the instructions above, and make sure you understand it.</li>
<li>Take the program above and modify it by adding the missing methods
    such that when the program is run, it might produce 
    <a href="https://www.cs.montana.edu/paxton/classes/csci127/inlabs/lab11/output.txt">this output</a>.  Note that your percents may be slightly different due to random values being generated each time
	you run the program, but your percents should still be pretty close. Do not change any of the
    existing Python code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Part 2: Matplotlib</h2>
<ul>
<li> coming soon </li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading - 10 points</h2>
<ul>
<li>3 points - Low Rolls are identified correctly.</li>
<li>3 points - Three of a Kinds are identified correctly.</li>
<li>4 points - Large straights are identified correctly.</li>
</ul>
