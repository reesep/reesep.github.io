<h3>Background and Directions</h3>
<p>
	You will be creating a virtual shopping list. Users can (1) view the grocery list, (2) add to the grocery list, (3) remove something from the grocery list, or (4) check to see if they already have an item on the list
	<br>
	<p> Using <a href="lab4.txt"> lab4.py as a starting point </a>, define and fill in the missing functions. The grocery list is represented by a python list</p>
	<ul>
		<li> <b> print_grocery_list() </b> should take in the grocery list, and print it out in a nice, numbered manner as seen in <a href = "lab4_printlist.JPG"> this screenshot </a> </li>
		<li> <b> add_to_grocery_list() </b> should take in the grocery list and an item the user wants to add. You will add it to the list and then return the new list with the new item added </li>
		<li> <b> remove_from_grocery_list() </b> should take in the grocery list and an item the user wants to remove. You will remove that item from the list and then return the new list with the item removed </li>
		<li> <b> check_if_item_on_list() </b> should take in the grocery list and an item the user wants to check if its already on the list. If the item is already on the list, then <b> "<insert item name here> is already on your grocery list!" </b> should be printed out.
				If the item is not on the list, then <b> "<insert item name here> is not on your grocery list!" </b> should be printed out.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
	
	

	
<h3> Hints </h3>

<ul>
	<li> We've talked about easy ways to add and remove things from lists</li>
	<li> Is your list not updating properly after adding/removing? Make sure you are returning the correct value </li>
	<li> Note that the items are case sensitive, so make sure that you input "Bread" and not "bread" when removing an item, for example.

</ul>



 

<h3> Sample Output </h3>
<p> When your program is run, it should follow a similar behavior as seen in <a href="lab4_output1.JPG"> this sample output </a> and <a href="lab4_output2.JPG"> this sample output </a>. 


<h3> Required Python Comment </h3>
<p> Place a Python comment at the top of your Python solution that is formatted as follows </p>
<pre>
# -----------------------------------------+
# Your name                                |  &lt;-- e.g. Reese Pearsall
# CSCI 127, Lab 4                          |
# Last Updated: Month Day, Year            |  &lt;-- e.g. December 3, 2020
# -----------------------------------------|
# A brief description of the assignment.   |  &lt;-- can be more than 1 line 
# -----------------------------------------+
</pre>
<h3>Grading (10 points) </h3>


<ul>
  <li>2 points - print_grocery_list() is defined and properly prints out the list of groceries just like in the sample output</li>
