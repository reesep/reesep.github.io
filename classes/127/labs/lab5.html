<h2>In order to complete this lab, you will need to understand</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Files </li>
	<li> ... and everything else we've talked about this semester </li>
</ul>


<h2>Assignment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Download the file <a href="earthquakes.csv">earthquakes.csv</a>.  
    This input file is
    described in detail <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/earthquakes/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Download <a href="lab5.txt">lab5.py</a> into the same directory
    where the earthquakes.csv file is located and rename it according 
    to the instructions in the Logistics section.</li>
<li>Implement the <b>average_magnitude</b> function such that it
    calculates and returns the average magnitude of the recorded
    earthquakes.</li>
<li>Implement the <b>earthquake_locations</b> function such that it
    identifies every unique location (use the <i>name</i> field in the file)
    and prints them in alphabetical order.</li>
<li>Implement the <b>count_earthquakes</b> function.  The function should
    calculate the number of recorded earthquakes that have a magnitude
    greater than or equal to the low bound and less than or equal
    to the high bound.  The user will specify the bounds and  
    you may assume that the user will enter valid numbers.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Hints </h2>
<ul>
	<li> You might run into some issues when finding the unique locations for <b> earthquake_locations</b>. One thing to notice is that the <b> locations.full  </b> has commas in the locations. Sometimes 
     there are two commas there and something there are no commas there. How does that affect things when you do <b> .split </b> ?	Think about how you can access <b> location.name </b> in a different way... </li>
</ul>

<h2>Sample Run</h2>
<ul>
<li>In this <a href="https://www.cs.montana.edu/paxton/classes/csci127/inlabs/lab6/output.txt">sample run</a>, the user inputs 5.0 for
    the lower bound and 6.0 for the upper bound.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Required Python Comment </h3>
<p> Place a Python comment at the top of your Python solution that is formatted as follows </p>
<pre>
# -----------------------------------------+
# Your name                                |  &lt;-- e.g. Reese Pearsall
# CSCI 127, Lab 5                          |
# Last Updated: Month Day, Year            |  &lt;-- e.g. December 3, 2020
# -----------------------------------------|
# A brief description of the assignment.   |  &lt;-- can be more than 1 line 
# -----------------------------------------+
</pre>
<h3>Grading (10 points) </h3>


<ul>
  <li>2 points - print_grocery_list() is defined and properly prints out the list of groceries just like in the sample output</li> 
  <li>2 points - add_to_grocery_list() is defined and properly adds the item to the grocery list </li> 
  <li>2 points - remove_from_grocery_list() is defined and properly removes the item from the grocery list </li>
  <li>2 points - check_if_item_on_list() is defined and properly prints out whether or not the item already exists on the list </li>
  <li>1 point - The sample output is followed in your submission </li>
  <li>1 point - The required Python comment appears at the top of your file</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading - 10 points</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 points - The <b>average_magnitude</b> function is correct.</li>
<li>3 points - The <b>earthquake_locations</b> function finds all
    of the unique locations (2 points) and prints each unique location
    once in sorted order (1 point).  </li>
<li>3 points - The <b>count_earthquakes</b> function is correct.</li>
<li>2 points - The format of the output matches exactly the format
    of the output transcript.  For each type of difference, 1 point
    will be deducted.</li>
</ul>
