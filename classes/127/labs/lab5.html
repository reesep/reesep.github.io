</ul>

<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Gain experience with files.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Download the file <a href="earthquakes.csv">earthquakes.csv</a>.  
    This input file is
    described in detail <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/earthquakes/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Download <a href="lab5.html">lab5.py</a> into the same directory
    where the earthquakes.csv file is located and rename it according 
    to the instructions in the Logistics section.</li>
<li>Implement the <b>average_magnitude</b> function such that it
    calculates and returns the average magnitude of the recorded
    earthquakes.</li>
<li>Implement the <b>earthquake_locations</b> function such that it
    identifies every unique location (use the <i>name</i> field in the file)
    and prints them in alphabetical order.</li>
<li>Implement the <b>count_earthquakes</b> function.  The function should
    calculate the number of recorded earthquakes that have a magnitude
    greater than or equal to the low bound and less than or equal
    to the high bound.  The user will specify the bounds and  
    you may assume that the user will enter valid numbers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sample Run</h2>
<ul>
<li>In this <a href="https://www.cs.montana.edu/paxton/classes/csci127/inlabs/lab6/output.txt">sample run</a>, the user inputs 5.0 for
    the lower bound and 6.0 for the upper bound.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading - 10 points</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 points - The <b>average_magnitude</b> function is correct.</li>
<li>3 points - The <b>earthquake_locations</b> function finds all
    of the unique locations (2 points) and prints each unique location
    once in sorted order (1 point).  </li>
<li>3 points - The <b>count_earthquakes</b> function is correct.</li>
<li>2 points - The format of the output matches exactly the format
    of the output transcript.  For each type of difference, 1 point
    will be deducted.</li>
</ul>
