<h3>Background and Directions</h3>
<p> It's often difficult to figure out where to eat at in Bozeman. You will be creating a program that asks the user for (1) what kind of food they are interested in and (2) how much money the have. The user will only answer with the following kinds of food: Asian, Mexican, Italian, Pizza, or Burgers. The user can have any amount of money
    Using that information, you will use logic to recommend a restaurant  
    to the user. The logic, which you will write, will be in a function called determine_restaurant(). This function  will return the name of the restaurant  that it recommends. The logic used in your program should follow the following criteria: </p>	
	<ul>
		<li> If the user ever has less 5 dollars or less, then <b>"Nowhere! You need more money!"</b> should be returned </li>
		<li> If the user selects Asian food and has between 5 and 12 dollars, then <b>"Panda Express" </b>should be returned </li>
		<li> If the user selects Asian food and has 12 or more dollars, then <b>"Dave's Sushi" </b>should be returned </li>
		<li> If the user selects Mexican food and has between 5 and 12 dollars, then <b>"Taco Bell"</b> should be returned </li>
		<li> If the user selects Mexican food and has 12 or more dollars, then <b>"Sante Fe Reds"</b> should be returned </li>
		<li> If the user selects Italian food and has between 5 and 12 dollars, then <b>"Olive Garden"</b> should be returned </li>
		<li> If the user selects Italian food and has 12 or more dollars, then <b>"Blacksmith Kitchen"</b> should be returned </li>
		<li> If the user selects pizza and has between 5 and 12 dollars, then <b>"Domino's Pizza"</b> should be returned </li>
		<li> If the user selects pizza and has  12 or more dollars, then <b>"Bridger Brewing</b> should be returned </li>
		<li> If the user selects burgers and has between 5 and 12 dollars, then <b>"McDonalds"</b> should be returned </li>
		<li> If the user selects burgers and has 12 or more dollars, then <b>"Burger Bob's"</b> should be returned </li>
		
	</ul>
	
	
	<p> Using <a href="lab3.txt"> lab3.py as a starting point </a>, define and fill in the determine_restaurant() function so that the correct restaurant recommendation is returned. You might find <a href="lab3_diagram.jpg"> this flowchart </a> helpful for understanding the logic of the program </p>
	
<h3> Hints </h3>

<ul>
	<li> There are many ways of structuring  your selection statements in this assignment. I would recommend using nested if statements. </li>
	<li> The user input and printing is already done for you. Your task is to implement the logic and return the correct values. </li>
	<li> For checking the type of food, you should be comparing the input parameter to the lowercase representation of the food </li>
	<ul>
		<li> For example, your if statement should read if(type_of_food == "asian"). It should NOT read if(type_of_food == "Asian") </li>
	</ul>
</ul>



 

<h3> Sample Output </h3>
<p> <a href="lab3_output1.JPG"> This sample output </a> shows a few test cases of how your program should function when ran. (Note that this sample output does not cover all possible outcomes that you need to implement)


<h3> Required Python Comment </h3>
<p> Place a Python comment at the top of your Python solution that is formatted as follows </p>
