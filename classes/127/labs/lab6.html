<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p> You have two options for lab 6. You must choose one of them.

<ul>
<h3> Option 1: Live virtual review session </h3>
<li> I will be hosting a live, virtual review session in my webex room at <b> 11:00 AM on Thursday, December 17th. </b> We will be going over the practice exam and also some practice exam problems. I will also answer any questions about stuff we've 
     learned so far if you bring them. If you show up and attend this review session, you will get a 10/10 for lab 6. You do <b> not </b> need to submit anything on D2L </li>
	 <br>
	 <h3> Option 2: Do any two example exam questions </h3>
	 <li> If you dont want to attend the review session, or can't make it, that is fine (I will likely record it anyway). Your other option is to attempt to solve <b> any </b> two example test questions that are listed on the course website. This will be ultimately based
	      on effort. You don't necessarily need to get them correct (	      on effort. You don't necessarily need to get them correct (although you really should try to). If you attempted two different questions and I can tell you put in effort, you will get a 10/10 for lab 6. If you do this option, you must upload your .py file with your you really should try to). If you attempted two different questions and I can tell you put in effort, you will get a 10/10 for lab 6. If you do this option, you must upload your .py file with your
