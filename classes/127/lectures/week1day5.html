<h2> Example Test Questions </h2>
<p> The body mass index (BMI) is calculated as a person's weight (in pounds) times 720, divided by the square of the person's height (in inches). A BMI in the range 19-25, inclusive, is considered healthy. Write a program that calculates a person's BMI
    and prints a message telling whether they are above, within, or below the healthy range. </p>

	The speeding ticket fine policy in Pearsallville is $50 plus $5 for each mph over the limit plus a penalty of $200 for any speed over 90 mph. Write a python function that accepts a speed limit and a clocked speed and either prints a message indicating the speed
	was legal or prints out the amount of the fine, if the speed was illegal

	A person is eligable to be a US senator if they are at least 30 years old and have been a US citizen for at least 9 years. To be a US representative these numbers are 27 and 7, respectively. Write a python function that accepts a person's
