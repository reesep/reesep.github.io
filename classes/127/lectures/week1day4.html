	<li> Be able to call a function </li>
	<li> Understand function parameters </li>
	<li> Understand the difference between a fruitful function and a non-fruitful function </li>

</ul>

<h2> To Do </h2>
<ul>
	<li> Get started on lab 2</li>
</ul>

<h2> Example Test Questions </h2>
<p> Pearsall's Pizzeria  offers delivery in Bozeman. The total delivery cost is equal to the total cost of the order plus $2 for every mile the employee drives to deliver the pizza. There is also a mandatory $3 delivery fee that is added onto the total. Write a python function that will
	take in the cost of the order and how many miles away the customer lives from the pizzeria. The function should return the total delivery cost </p>
	
	<br>
	
	Write a python function that will take in the cost of a dinner bill at a restaurant. The function should then prompt the user for what percent tip they want to leave (20%, 15%, etc). The function should calculate the amount to tip the waiter/waitress based on what percent tip they want and the order total. For example, if the dinner bill is $100 and they want to leave a %20 tip, the function should return $20 for a tip.
