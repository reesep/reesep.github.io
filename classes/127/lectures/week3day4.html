You can print the these pages and fill them out by hand and scan it into a PDF, or you can virtually fill out the exam and save it as a PDF. The first three pages will be submitted to a D2L dropbox as a <b> PDF. </b> </li>
		<li> The programming problems will be submitted to a different D2L dropbox. You may have a single .py file for all 3 questions, or 3 .py files for each question. <b> Make sure you clearly name your files and put your name at the top of each program in a comment </b> </li>
	</ul>
	
	<li> You cannot use a late pass on the midterm exam. The deadline at 11:59 PM is <b> strict </b> </li>

<h2> Midterm Exam Overview </h2>
The following content is fair game on the Midterm Exam

	<li> Operators (+, -, *, %, ...)</li>
	<li> User Input </li>
	<li> .format </li>
	<li> Functions </li>
	<li> Selection </li>
	<li> Iteration (for/while loops) </li>
	<li> Lists </li>
	<li> Nested Lists </li>
	<li> Strings </li>
	<li> Modules (math/random) </li>
	<li> Files (reading/writing) </li>
</ul>

<h2> Midterm Exam Format </h2>

100 Points total
<ul>
	<li> 10 Multiple choice / True or False questions (2 pts each)</li>
	<ul>
		Questions such as:
		<li> What does this code print out? </li>
		<li> What is wrong with this code? </li>
		<li> Which of the following is/is not _____ </li>
		<li> Other typical MC questions about concepts we discussed in class </li>
		I will pull two of these questions directly from the practice exam.
	</ul>
	
	<li> 3 short programming problems </li>
	 Given a problem, you will write a Python solution that will solve it. You will need to write a function or a program (no function required) to solve the problem
	 <ul>
		<li> Problem 1: Basic Python Program / Computation (20 pts)</li>
		<li> Problem 2: Selection / If Statements (25 pts)</li>
		<li> Problem 3: Nested Lists (35 pts) </li>
	</ul>
	I will pull one of these problems directly from one of the example test questions from the course website. These questions are similar in size to most of the examples we've done in class.
</ul>
	
<h2> Tips </h2> 

Be sure to attempt every problem. Even if you cannot fully solve one the programming problems. You should try to get as much done as you can. I will give out as much partial credit as I can even if you cannot fully solve it.

<br>

Read the multiple choice problems and the given code carefully. Some questions will be intentionally tricky.

<br>

Read the programming problems instructions carefully. Make sure you understand what is being asked and what you need to do (write a function, what the inputs are, what the output should be, etc)
