(NOTE: This may change based on number of students in the class)
<br /><br />
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday 10:10 AM - 12:05 PM
<br /><br />
Each day will contain either 2 hours-ish of lectures OR 1 hour of lecture and 1 hour of lab
<br /><br />
<b>Lecture:</b> Lectures and delivery of lectures will be done asynchronously, which means we do not “meet” for lectures. There is no live zoom lecture. Lectures will be posted on D2L before class time everyday. It is your responsibility to watch the lectures.
<br /><br />
<b>Lab:</b> Labs will be done synchronously(??) in Webex. There will be roughly two labs each week (see course schedule for lab dates and times). The labs will take place during the 2nd half of class time (11:05 - 12:05) on the days when labs happen. Lab attendance is not required. On the days with 2 hours of lecture, there will not be a lab

<h2>Textbook and Resources</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The online <a href="http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/thinkcspy/index.html">textbook</a> is  <b> FREE.</b> </li>
  <li>Python 3.9 and IDLE editor are required:

</ul>

<h2>Catalog Description</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Credits: 4</li>
  <li>Corequisite: M 151Q Pre-Calculus</li>
  <li>Recommended Prerequisite:  Prior programming experience OR  CSCI 107 Joy and Beauty of Computing</li>
  <li>Description: Provides a gentle introduction to the exciting world 
      of big data and data science. Students expand their ability to solve 
      problems with Python by learning to deploy lists, files, dictionaries 
      and object-oriented programming. Data science libraries are introduced 
      that enable data to be manipulated and displayed.</li>
</ul>
<p> <b> Note from Reese: </b> While prior programming experience or 107 is recommeneded as a prerequisite, you can still easily succeed in this course if you have never programmed before. 
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Just be ready to put in a little more effort. </p>

<h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
<p>
  By the end of this course, students should be be able to: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Utilize lists, files, dictionaries and arrays to solve problems in Python.</li>
  <li>Utilize fundamental object oriented principles such as classes, objects, methods and inheritance to solve problems in Python.</li>
  <li>Utilize data science libraries to solve data science problems in Python.</li>
  <li>Understand the broad area of data science and its relevance.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Grading</h2>


30% - Exams (Two exams @ 15% each) <br>
30% - Programs (5 Progams @ 6% each) <br>
25% - Labs (2.5% each x 10) Lowest lab grade will be dropped <br>
10% - Watching Online Lectures <br>
5% - 1 on 1 Meetings w/ Reese <br>

<h2> Grading Breakdown </h2>
<b> Exams (30%)-  </b> There will be two exams given during the snowmester. The exams will consist of multiple choice and short programming problems. The exams will be completely online and you will have ~12 hours to complete it. 
You CAN use your computer, the textbook, and any notes you have on the exam. You CANNOT use the internet (stackoverflow, w3schools, youtube, etc)
<br><br>
<b> Labs (25%)-  </b> Because this is a 4 credit class, there is a lab portion of the class. There will be roughly two labs each week (see course schedule for lab dates and times). 
The labs allow you to get experience with the course topics taught in class. The programming assingments are typically shorter, and should only take 1-2 hours to complete. 
Labs are due on the day at the lab at 11:59 P.M. , but late work is accepted (see Late Assingments section). Labs will be posted a day or two ahead of time for those that want to get started early.
<br><br>
<b> Programs (30%)- </b> Programs are more lengthy programming assingments that are to be done outside of class. There are 5 programs assinged throughout the semester and are due Wednesdays at 11:59 PM, but late work is accepted (see Late Assingments section).
 You have roughly 1 week to complete the programs, and I will likely hold seperate help sessions on webex each week. Programs should take 2-4 hours to complete.
<br><br>
<b> Watching online lectures (10%)- </b> I want you to succeed in this course, and for you to do that, you need to watch the lectures. I am able to see who watched the lectures and how much of the lecture you watched. 
At the end of the semester, I will go through all the lecture at the end of semester and verify who watched the lectures. If you watch all the lectures, you will get an easy 10% of your grade
<br><br>
<b> 1 on 1 Meetings w/ Reese (5%)-  </b> You will be required to meet with me via webex (outside of office hours) at least once/twice[?] during the semester. You will sign up for a time to meet with me. 
This meeting is mostly just a check-in to make sure you are doing ok with a class and give you some 1 on 1 support if you need it.
<br><br>

<h2>Grading Scale</h2>


<ul>
  <li>93+: A</li>
  <li>90+: A-</li>
  <li>87+: B+</li>
  <li>83+: B</li>
  <li>80+: B-</li>
  <li>77+: C+</li>
  <li>73+: C</li>
  <li>70+: C-</li>
  <li>67+: D+</li>
  <li>63: D</li>
  <li>60: D-</li>
</ul>

Q: Do you curve exams or final grades? <br>
A: Maybe, but don’t bet on it. If exams or final grades are lower than I anticipated, then I may apply a curve. For final grades, if you are within 1% of the next letter grade, I will bump you up.


<h2> Late Assingment Policy (IMPORTANT) </h2>
<b><h4>Note: This late assingment policy is VERY subject to change depending on the size of the class. <br></b></h4>
I understand that people have plans over the holiday break. You may have family obligations, or may be picking up more shifts with your job. I understand you might not be able to watch the lectures everyday or have time to work on assingments. 
My goal is to offer you flexiblity during these strange times. Because of this, late assingments are accepted with NO PENALTY. <br>
<br>
There are deadlines for each assingment, which I HIGHLY recommend following. However you may submit assingments past those deadlines. There are two major deadlines during the semester. <br>
<br>
Labs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and Programs 1 and 2 MUST BE SUBMITTED BY Thursday 12/17 @ 11:59 P.M. This is right before the midterm exam. You cannot submit any of those assingnments past this deadline. <br>
<br>
Labs 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and Programs 3, 4 and 5 MUST BE SUBMITTED BY Thursday 1/7 @ 11:59 P.M. This is right before the final exam. You cannot submit any of those assingments past this deadline <br>
<br>
IMPORTANT NOTE: You should not use this policy to wait and submit everything right before these deadlines. If you do decide to submit everything the day of these deadlines, I will likely not grade it. <br>
<br>
More information will be covered on the first day of class. <br>

<h2> Getting Help and Succeeding </h2>

<h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>

<p>
  All students should read the 
  <a href="http://www2.montana.edu/policy/student_conduct/">MSU
  Student Conduct Code</a>.
</p>

<p>
  When it comes to Python assignments, you <i> may </i> 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work with the other people on your team if teams are allowed.
      Each assignment will specify the maximum number of people per team.</li>
  <li>Share ideas with people in other teams.</li>
  <li>Help other teams troubleshoot problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You may <i>NOT</i>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share code you write with other teams.</li>
  <li>Submit code that someone on your team did not write.</li>
  <li>Modify another team's solution and claim it as your own.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Failure to abide by these rules will result in an "F"
  for the course and being reported to the Dean of Students.
</p>

<h2> Plagarism </h2>
<p> TO DO </p>


<h2>Diversity Statement</h2>
<p>
  Montana State University's campuses are committed to providing an 
  environment that emphasizes the dignity and worth of every member of its 
  community and that is free from harassment and discrimination based upon 
  race, color, religion, national origin, creed, 
  service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), 
  veterans status, sex, age, political ideas, marital or family status, 
  pregnancy, physical or mental disability, genetic information, gender 
  identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation.  Such an environment 
  is necessary to a healthy learning, working, and living atmosphere because 
  discrimination and harassment undermine human dignity and the positive 
  connection among all people at our University. Acts of discrimination, 
  harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, 
  stalking, and retaliation will be addressed consistent with this policy. 
</p>
