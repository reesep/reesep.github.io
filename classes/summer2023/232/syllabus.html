<h2>Textbook</h2>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X">(Optional) Algorithms (4th Edition) by Sedgewick and Wayne.</a></li>

  <br>
  
  <li> The textbooks are not required, but I would recommend it if you are truly trying to get the most out of this course. </li>
 
</ul>


<h2> Other Required Materials</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Java IDE (choose one of the following)</li>
  <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows">IntelliJ</a></li>

  </ul>
  All of these are free to download and use. I will be using and recommending Eclipse in this class, but you can use any of the IDEs above. IntelliJ is a great IDE, but you must register for a student license with your MSU email

</ul>

<h2> Class Communication </h2>
<ul>
	<li> <a href="">Discord server link</a></li>
  <li>I will be using Discord to make announcements, answer any questions, discuss course material, and help debug issues. Please do not overshare answers or solutions in the public channels</li>
  <li>I am literally always on Discord, so you always shoot me a DM whenever. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Catalog Description</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Credits: 4</li>
  <br>
  <li>Prerequisite: CSCI 132- Basic Data Structures and Algorithms (Required)</li>

  <br>
  <li>Description:  Advanced data structures and programming techniques and their application. Topics include: trees, balanced trees, graphs, dictionaries, hash tables, heaps. Examines the efficiency and correctness of algorithms. The laboratory uses Java.</li>
</ul>
<p> <b> Note from Reese:</b> Before taking this class, you should feel comfortable basic Java programming, arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, recursion, and algorithm analysis using big-O notation</p>

<h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
<p>
  By the end of this course, students should be be able to: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Independently design, write, and test programs of moderate complexity. </li>
  <li> Be able to implement the following data structures: trees, hash tables, graphs </li>
  <li> Identify the tradeoffs of various data structures and make a defensible decision as to which one(s) to use for a given problem. </li>
  <li> Be able to formally detail the performance of an algorithm and identify the factors limiting that performance. </li>
</ul>


<h2>Grading</h2>



35% - Labs  <br>
40% - Programs (4 programs, 10% each) <br>
15% - Quizzes <br>
10% - Participation/Check-In <br>

<h2> Grading Breakdown </h2>

<ul>
    <li> Labs- </li>
    <li> Programs-  </li>
    <li> Quizzes- </li> 
    <li> Participation/Check-In- </li> 
</ul>



<h2>Grading Scale</h2>


<ul>
  <li>93+: A</li>
  <li>90+: A-</li>
  <li>87+: B+</li>
  <li>83+: B</li>
  <li>80+: B-</li>
  <li>77+: C+</li>
  <li>73+: C</li>
  <li>70+: C-</li>
  <li>67+: D+</li>
  <li>63: D</li>
  <li>60: D-</li>
</ul>

Q: Do you curve exams or final grades? <br>
A: Maybe, but probably not. If exams or final grades are lower than I anticipated, then I may apply a curve. For final grades, if you are within 1% of the next letter grade, I will bump you up.


<h2> Late Assignment Policy </h2>
 
<ul>
	<li> < 24 hours: 25% </li>
	<li> < 48 Hours 50% </li>
	<li> > 48 hours: no credit. </li>
</ul>
<br>


<h2> Getting Help and Succeeding </h2>

We go through the basics of Java pretty quick in this class (the first 3 weeks). If you get behind or confused early on, it will make the rest of the class very difficult. This course IS NOT a good class to slack off/mentally check out in and it is NOT nice to people that don't ask for help if they need it. I (reese) am also here for you and I want to help you in whatever way that I can to help you succeed. You can always email me or send me a discord message, and I will respond as soon as I can (you can generally expect a response back within 5ish hours). You should always give yourself enough time to complete the assignments, and you should never start programs the day they are due (remember that bugs and issues will likely come up as you are coding!!!).





<h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>

<p>
  All students should read the 
  <a href="http://www2.montana.edu/policy/student_conduct/">MSU
  Student Conduct Code</a>.
</p>
<p> All labs will be individual submissions. For programs, you are allowed to work with <b>one</b>partner. Each partner should submit to D2L (but make sure you indicate in your submission who your partner is).</p>


<p>
  When it comes to labs and programs, you <i> may </i> 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share ideas with other students in the class.</li>
  <li> Work together on labs in the same physical location. </li>
  <li>Help other students troubleshoot problems.</li>
  <li>Give hints or provide textbook page numbers/slide numbers to students seeking help</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You may <i>NOT</i>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share your code and solutions directly with other students.</li>
  <li>Submit solutions that you did not write.</li>
  <li>Modify another student's solution and claim it as your own.</li>
  <li>Share your report or solutions directly on Discord </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Failure to abide by these rules will result in an "F"
  for the course and being reported to the Dean of Students.
</p>

<h2> Bots and AI </h2>
<p> You should not use any bots or AI to develop your solutions on labs or programs. If it is found that you used such a tool, you will receive a zero on the assignment.</p>

<h2> Plagiarism </h2>
<p> You may not copy or modify solutions that are not your own (e.g. from the Internet, classmate, ...) for any graded material. Copying and pasting very small snippets of code is acceptable, however copying/pasting or stealing entire solutions from an external source is prohibited. I know how to use the Google and I have a Chegg membership, so If you find something, I will too! It is easy for me to tell if you copy and pasted code from the Internet, so please do not engage in such academic misconduct. If I find a student engaging in plagiarism, I will have to report you to the Dean of Students. </p>
