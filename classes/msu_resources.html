        <h2>Diversity Statement</h2>
            <p>
            Montana State University's campuses are committed to providing an 
            environment that emphasizes the dignity and worth of every member of its 
            community and that is free from harassment and discrimination based upon 
            race, color, religion, national origin, creed, 
            service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), 
            veteran's status, sex, age, political ideas, marital or family status, 
            pregnancy, physical or mental disability, genetic information, gender 
            identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation.  Such an environment 
            is necessary to a healthy learning, working, and living atmosphere because 
            discrimination and harassment undermine human dignity and the positive 
            connection among all people at our University. Acts of discrimination, 
            harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, 
            stalking, and retaliation will be addressed consistent with this policy. 
            </p>

        <h2>Inclusivity Statement</h2>
        <p>I support an inclusive learning environment where diversity and individual differences are understood, respected, appreciated, and recognized as a source of strength. We expect that students, faculty, administrators and staff at MSU will respect differences and demonstrate diligence in understanding how other peoples' perspectives, behaviors, and worldviews may be different from their own. </p>

       <h2>Counseling</h2>

        <p> In addition to eating right, taking breaks when you need them, and getting enough sleep, you may benefit from talking to a professional counselor if you think stress could be impacting your health. Here is a blurb and some links from MSU’s Counseling & Psychological Services:

            MSU strives to create a culture of support and recognizes that your mental health and wellness are equally as important as your physical health. We want you to know that it’s OK if you experience difficulty, and there are several resources on campus to help you succeed emotionally, personally, and academically:

       <p>There should be no discrimination or harassment for anyone at MSU. If you notice anything that seems to violate that principle, the Office of Institutional Equity can help. As an employee of MSU, I am a mandatory reporter, which means if I learn of any discrimination or harassment at MSU, I am obligated by my contract to report it.
