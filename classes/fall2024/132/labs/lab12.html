<h3> Background Information</h3>

Binary search (as discussed in class on Monday, November 18th) is an efficient searching algorithm used for looking up information in a sorted collection. 
<br><br>
For example, imagine flipping through a dictionary to find a word. Instead of starting at page one and working forward, you would likely open the book near the middle, 
check if the word comes before or after that point, and repeat the process with the appropriate half of the dictionary. This method drastically reduces the number of pages 
you need to flip. In binary search, this "halving" strategy is what gives it its O(logN) efficiency.

<br>


<h3>Directions </h3>

    Using <a href="Lab12Demo.java">Lab12Demo.java</a> as a starting point, you will implement binary search by filling in the body of the <tt>binary_search</tt> method. 
    You cannot modify anything in the main() method or add any other methods. 
    <br>
    <br>
    If the middle element is alphabetically smaller than the target value (word you're searching for), 
    you eliminate the left half of the array, and recalculate the mid point. If the middle value is alphabetically greater than the target value, you eliminate the right half of the array, 
    and recalculate the mid point.<br>

    <br>

    The <tt>binary_search</tt> method takes an array of alphabetically sorted strings, and a string value to search for. This method needs to return the index of the search value. If the value is not in the array, the method should return -1. </b>

    <br><br>

	We did this algorithm in class on 11/18. You can get most of it from the class notes ðŸ˜Š. 

    <h3> Starting Code </h3>    
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="Lab12Demo.java">Lab12Demo.java</a> </li>

       

        
    </ul>

    <h3> Output</h3>
    When you run your program, your output should look like this:
