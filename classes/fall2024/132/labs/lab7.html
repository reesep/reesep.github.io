<h1>Lab 7:  Stacks</h1>


<h2>Due Date and Submission Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Due Date: Thursday, October 17th at 11:59 p.m.</li>
  <li>Partner Information: This is an individual assignment. You are allowed to collaborate with other students, but each student must submit their individual, independent solution.</li> 
  <li> Submission Instructions: Submit your solution, BookStack.java and Book.java to the appropriate D2L dropbox. </li>

</ul>

<hr />

<h2>The goal of this lab is:</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Gain experience using a Stack data structure</li>
  <li> Implement a stack in Java using an array</li>
</ul>

<hr />


<h3>Directions </h3>

    Using <a href="Lab7Demo.java">Lab7Demo.java</a> as a starting point, you will fill in the missing methods for the <tt>BookStack</tt> class, which are defines in the interace <tt>StackMethods</tt>. The stack class implements this interface, so you must ride all methods from the interface. <br><br>

    Your Stack will hold Book objects, and <b>must use an array to hold its data </b>. This array must be able to dynamically grow if the array is at capacity. You are not allowed to use an ArrayList.

<br>	

	You must define the Book class and write the methods you think you will need. Each Book object has a title (String) and an author (String).

    <br><br>

    You are NOT allowed to modify the Lab7Demo class. After creating the BookStack class, you must define the following methods (which are also defined in the interface):
    <ul>
        <li>push(Book newElement)- This push() method adds a new Book object (newBook) to the top of the stack. If the Stack/Array is full, your code should dynamically grow the array by one spot. You can use the code we discussed in class, but I would recommend looking at the documentation for the <tt>Arrays.copyOf()</tt> method.</li>
        <li>pop()- the pop() method removes and returns the top element of the stack</li>
        <li>peek()- the peek() method returns the current top element of the stack</li>
        <li>getSize()- returns the current size of the stack</li>
        <li>isEmpty()- returns true of the stack is empty, returns false if the stack is not empty</li>
        <li>printStack() - prints out each element in the stack. The top of the stack is the first thing printed out, the bottom of the stack is the last thing printed out.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Starting Code </h3>    
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="Lab7Demo.java">Lab7Demo.java</a> </li>
	<li> <a href="BookStack.java">BookStack.java</a> </li>
	<li> <a href="StackMethods.java">StackMethods.java (Interface)</a> </li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3> Output</h3>
    When you run your program, your output should look <b>exactly</b> <a href="lab7_output.PNG">like this screenshot</a>



	<h3> Rules</h3>
	<ul>
		<li> You are not allowed to import Stack </li>
		<li> You are not allowed to use ArrayLists </li>
	</ul>
	
</p>	

<h3>Grading (10 points) </h3>

<ul>
  <li>2 points- push() is correct</li>
