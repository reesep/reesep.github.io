<h1>Extra Credit Opportunity</h1>

<p> If you fill out the course/instructor evaluation for the class, and upload a screenshot of the confirmation screen to D2L, I will add 2% to your final exam score.  <br>
    Your feedback and insights help me improve as an instructor and educator. After grad school, I want to become a computer science instructor at a university/college (hopefully here at MSU!!), so your feedback helps me know how good/bad I am doing and what I can do differently.
	
	<br>
	Given that I am early in my teaching career, your feedback is <b> very </b> important and meaningful to me and I will take it very seriously.If I teach this class again, your feedback will help make this class a better experience for future students. 
	<br>
	This feedback will also be read by my department head, so it is helpful for them to know if I did a good/bad job. I want to have more teaching opportunities in the future, so  your feedback is important for the department head to make decisions on if Reese is allowed to teach again :-)  </p>
