	<ul>
		<li> The first 4 pages of the exam will be the title page and the multiple choice questions. You can print the these pages and fill them out by hand and scan it into a PDF, or you can virtually fill out the exam  (In Word, pdf editor, etc) and save it as a PDF. The first four pages will be submitted to a D2L dropbox as a <b> PDF. </b> </li>
		<li> The programming problems will be submitted to a different D2L dropbox. You may have a single .py file for all 4 questions, or 4 .py files for each question. <b> Make sure you clearly name your files and put your name at the top of each program in a comment </b> </li>
	</ul>
	
	<li> You cannot use a late pass on the final exam. The deadline at 8:00 AM is <b> strict </b> </li>
</ul>


<h2> Rules </h2>

You may use the following on the final exam:
<ul>
	<li> Notes </li>
	<li> Lecture Slides </li>
	<li> In class examples </li>
	<li> Previous Labs/Programs </li>
	<li> The textbook </li>
	<li> IDLE to develop your python solutions </li>
	<li> Lecture Recordings </li>
	<li> Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas online documentation </li>
</ul>

<br>
You <b> can not </b> use the following on the final exam

<h2> Final Exam Overview </h2>
The following content is fair game on the Final Exam 
<ul>
	<li> Files </li>
	<li> Dictionaries </li>
	<li> Object Oriented Programming </li>
	<li> Inheritance </li>
	<li> Magic Methods </li>
	<li> Numpy </li>
	<li> Matplotlib </li>
	<li> Pandas </li>
	<br>
	<br>
	<li> <b> NOTE: </b> You will still need to use most of things we learned in the first half of the class (loops, if statements, functions, etc) on the final exam... so the final exam is <b> cumulative </b> in a sense. </li>
	<!--
	<li> Data Types/Variables</li>
	<li> Operators (+, -, *, %, ...)</li>
	<li> User Input </li>
	<li> .format </li>
	<li> Functions </li>
	<li> Selection </li>
	<li> Iteration (for/while loops) </li>
	<li> Lists </li>
	<li> Nested Lists </li>
	<li> Strings </li>
	<li> Modules (math/random) </li>
	<li> Files (reading/writing) </li>
	-->
</ul>

<h2> Final Exam Format </h2>

100 Points total
<ul>
	<li> 10 Multiple choice / True or False/ <b> Matching </b> / <b> Short Response </b> questions (2 pts each)</li>
	<ul>
		Questions such as:
		<li> What does this code print out? </li> b
		<li> What is wrong with this code? </li>
		<li> Which of the following is/is not _____ </li>
		<li> Match the following lines of code to the correct output </li>
		<li> Other typical MC questions about concepts we discussed in class </li>
		I will pull two of these questions directly from the practice exam.
	</ul>
	
	<li> <b> 4 </b> short programming problems </li>
	 Given a problem, you will write a Python solution that will solve it. You will need to write a function or a program (no function required) to solve the problem. For OOP questions, you will likely need to create a class and methods
	 <ul>
		<li> Problem 1: Dictionaries (20 pts)</li>
		<li> Problem 2: Object Oriented Programming (20 pts)</li>
		<li> Problem 3: Object Oriented Programming (Inheritance or Magic Methods) (there will be a small Numpy aspect as well)</li>
		<li> Problem 4: Matplotlib (20 pts) </li>
	</ul>
	I will pull one of these problems directly from one of the example test questions from the course website. These questions are similar in size to most of the examples we've done in class.
</ul>
	
<h2> Tips </h2> 

Be sure to attempt every problem. Even if you cannot fully solve one the programming problems. You should try to get as much done as you can. I will give out as much partial credit as I can even if you cannot fully solve it.

<br>

Read the multiple choice problems and the given code carefully. Some questions will be intentionally tricky.

<br>

Read the programming problems instructions carefully. Make sure you understand what is being asked and what you need to do (write a function, what the inputs are, what the output should be, etc)
