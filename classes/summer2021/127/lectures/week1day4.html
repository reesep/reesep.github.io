<h2> To Do </h2>
<ul>
	<li> Enjoy the weekend</li>
	<li> Get started on lab 2 if you want </li>
</ul>

<h2> Example Test Questions </h2>
<ul>
<li> Pearsall's Pizzeria  offers delivery in Bozeman. The total delivery cost is equal to the total cost of the order plus $2 for every mile the employee drives to deliver the pizza. There is also a mandatory $3 delivery fee that is added onto the total. Write a python function that will
	take in the cost of the order and how many miles away the customer lives from the pizzeria. The function should return the total delivery cost </li>
	
	<br>
	
	<li> Write a python function that will take in the cost of a dinner bill at a restaurant. The function should then prompt the user for what percent tip they want to leave (20%, 15%, etc). The function should calculate the amount to tip the waiter/waitress based on what percent tip they want and the order total. For example, if the dinner bill is $100 and they want to leave a %20 tip, the function should return $20 for a tip. </li>
	
	<br>
	<li> A person is eligible  to be a US senator if they are at least 30 years old and have been a US citizen for at least 9 years. To be a US representative these numbers are 27 and 7, respectively. Write a python function that accepts a person's
	age and years of citizenship as input and outputs their eligibility for the Senate and House. </li>
	<br>
	<li> The body mass index (BMI) is calculated as a person's weight (in pounds) times 720, divided by the square of the person's height (in inches). A BMI in the range 19-25, inclusive, is considered healthy. Write a program that calculates a person's BMI
    and prints a message telling whether they are above, within, or below the healthy range. </li>
