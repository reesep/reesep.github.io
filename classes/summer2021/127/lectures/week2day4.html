<h2> Goals </h2>
<ul>
	<li> Understand how to create a string from a list and vice versa </li>
	<li> Understand what a tuple is  </li>
	<li> Understand what a nested list is and how to deal with them </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li> Finish and submit Program 1 </li>
	<li> Finish and submit Lab 4 </li>
	<li> Get started on Program 2 </li>
</ul>

<h2> Example Test Questions </h2>
<ul>
	<li>Consider a nested list that contains information about days running a lemonade stand. Each day contains the total revenue of that day and the total expenses for that day. For example consider the following nested list: [[31,10],[60,23], [42,12]] . $31 is the total revenue for day 1 and $10 is the total expenses for day 1. $60 is
	    the total revenue for day 2, etc. Write a function that will calculate the profit for each day as well as the total profit overall from the lemonade stand. For example, if [[31,10],[60,23], [42,12]] is the input, then the following output should be produced: </li>
		<pre>
			Day 1 profit: $21
			Day 2 profit: $37
			Day 3 profit: $30
			Total Profit: $88
		</pre>
		<br>
	<li> Consider a nested list that contains a score from a sports game. The Lists contain the team name and how many points they scores. For example, the nested could look like [["Bears",33],["Falcons",27]]. Write a python function that will take in a nested list and return which team won the game.
	     The winning team is the team that scores the most points. For example, if [["Bears",33],["Falcons",27]] is the input, then "Bears" should be returned. If [["Tigers",33],["Lions",63]] is the input, then "Lions" should be returned.</li>
