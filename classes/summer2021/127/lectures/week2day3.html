<h2> Goals </h2>
<ul>
	<li> Understand what lists are </li>
	<li> Understand what list indices are how to access specific elements in a list </li>
	<li> Understand how to add to and remove from lists  </li>
	<li> Understand how to iterate through lists </li>
	<li> Understand how list slicing works </li>
	<li> Understand the other list functions (sort(), count(), reverse(), etc)</li>
</ul>

<h2> To Do </h2>
<ul>
	<li> Work on Lab 3 </li>
	<li> Work on Program 1 </li>
	<li> Start on Lab 4 </li>
</ul>

<h2> Example Test Questions </h2>
<ul>
	<li>Write a program that calculates the average word length in a sentence entered by a user</li>
	<br>
	<li>Write a python function that reverses a list of items WITHOUT using the built in .reverse() function </li>
	<br>
	<li> Write a function <b> replace(s, old, new) </b> that replaces all occurences of <b>old </b> with <b> new </b> in a string <b>s </b>       Hint: use the .split() and .join() functions. For example, when <b> replace("Hello world","Hello","Hola") </b> is called, 
	     then "Hola World" will be printed out. </li>
		 <br>
	<li> Consider a list where the words "start" and "end" will always appear at some index, however you can assume that "start" will always appear before "end". For example ["start","hello","dog","cat","end","foo"] or ["foo","bar","start","dog","end"]. Your job is to write a python
		 function that will take in a list of any size. The function should return the slice of the list that  starts with "start" and ends with "end". For example, if ["foo","bar","start","dog","end"] is the input, then ["start","dog","end"] should be returned. If ["start","hello","dog","cat","end","foo"]
		 is the input, then ["start","hello","dog","cat","end"] should be returned.
</ul>
