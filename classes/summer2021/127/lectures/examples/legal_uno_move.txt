# Consider a simplified game of UNO that has forty different
# cards. Each card has a color ("red", "yellow", "green" or
# "blue") and a value (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9).
# Complete the boolean function below so that it returns
# True if the second card can be played on the first card
# and False otherwise.
