# Write a Python program that generates a random
# number between 1 and 10. The program should
# repeatedly ask the user to guess what the
# number is until the user guesses correctly.
# When the user guesses correctly, the program
# should print a message that shows how many
# tries it took. For example, the message might
# beÂ Congratulations! That took 6 guesses.
