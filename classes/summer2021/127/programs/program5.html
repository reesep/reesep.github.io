<li>Partner Information:You may complete this assignment individually or with exactly one partner.</li> 
  <li> Submission Instructions (working alone): Upload your solution (.py file), entitled <b>YourFirstName-YourLastName-Program4.py</b> to the BrightSpace(D2L) Program 4 Dropbox. </li>
   <li> Submission Instructions (working with a partner): Upload your solution (.py file), entitled <b>YourFirstName-YourLastName-PartnerFirstName-PartnerLastName-Program4.py</b> to the BrightSpace(D2L) Program 4 </li>   
  <li>Deadline Reminder: Late passes can be used on this assignment. However, if you do not use a late pass and submit it past the deadline, you submission will lose some points (see late assignment policy). After 48 hours,
	  the dropbox will close and you will no longer be able to submit </li>
</ul>

<h2>In order to complete this lab, you will need to understand</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Matplotlib </li>
	<li> Pandas (optional) </li>
	<li> numpy (optional) </li>
</ul>


     

<h2>Assignment Directions</h2>
<ul>
<li>  For this assignment, you will be producing two different visualizations that help the user gain insight into the information contained in a csv file</li>
<li> You may select <b> any </b> of the csv files from the <a href="https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/"> CORGIS CSV Datasets </a> (although, if you use the weather or earthquakes one, I will call you lame). Using that CSV file, you will create two different types of visualizations (you cannot have two of the same kind of graph)</li>
<li> It should be clear to the user what information is being graphed, so you need to include appropriate titles, labels, etc</li>
<li> You can use Matplotlib or Pandas (or both) to create the visualizations. Numpy may also be used </li>
<li> There should be <b> no </b> user input. Your program should just produce the visualizations </li>
<li>  You will develop the solution from scratch. I would recommend placing both of your graphs inside into a seperate function of some kind (i.e. def create_graph_one() and def create_graph_two() ). </li>
<li> Some CSV files may be easier to work with than others. I've seen this assignment work for the video_games.csv file and airlines.csv file.	
	
</ul> 


<h2> Starting code </h2>
<ul>
	<a href="https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/"> Any of the CORGIS CSV Datasets </a>
</ul>


<h2> Submission Instructions </h2>
<ul>
	<li> You should submit your <b>py file and the .csv file you used </b> to D2L </li>
</ul>


<h2>Grading - 100 points</h2>
<ul>
 <li>50 points - <b>Matplotlib</b> or <b> Pandas </b> is used to produce two insightful 
    visualizations.  Each visualization worth 25 points.</li>
<li>10 points - Each visualization is a different type.  For example,
    one visualization could be a bar chart and the other could
    be a pie chart.  All or nothing.</li>
<li>10 points - The visualizations use the underlying data to 
    show different things. All or nothing.</li> 
<li>20 points - All aspects of each visualization are clearly labeled and effort was put into making the graph different (don't just use the default settings).
    3 points for each type of improvement up to 20 points.
<li>10 points - You selected a CSV file from the CORGIS csv dataset provided the source csv in your submission</li>

</ul>
