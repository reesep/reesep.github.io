<h2>In order to complete this lab, you will need to understand</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Iteration  </li>
  <li> If statements </li>
  <li> Functions </li>
  <li> Variables and data types </li>
  <li> User input</li> 
</ul>


<h2>Background Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>At Montana State University, the following grades have 
    the following values:
    A (4.0), A- (3.7), B+ (3.3), B (3.0), B- (2.7), C+ (2.3),
    C (2.0), C- (1.7), D+ (1.3), D (1.0) and F (0.0).</li>
<li>Example GPA Calculation: If a student earns an A in a 3 credit course 
    and a B- in a 2 credit course, that student's GPA can be 
    calculated as (4.0 * 3 + 2.7 * 2) / (3 + 2). </li>
</ul>  

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write a Python program that prompts the user for the
    number of classes taken and then for each class, the letter grade
    received (e.g. B+) and the number of credits (e.g. 3).  Once this
    information is known, the program should calculate 
    and display the overall GPA (rounded to two digits). 
	
	<br><br>
	
	You will have a <b> main </b> function that asks for the number of classes, and the letter grade/credit for each of those classes. It will then calculate the final GPA and print it out to the screen (see sample output). 
	You will also have a <b> translate </b> function, which will be called from main(). The translate function will take in a letter grade as input parameter (e.g. b+ or B+) and return the correct decimal value (e.g. 3.3). Note that the user can input a letter grade
	in uppercase (A-) or in lowercase (a-) and your translate function should still work.</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
<li>The user will take at least one and no more than seven courses.</li>
<li>Each course is either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 credits.</li>
<li>A grade can be entered in uppercase or lowercase.
    For example, either <b>A-</b> or <b>a-</b>.</li>
<li>All user inputs will be valid.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Required Output </h3>
<p> When your program is run, it should look exactly like <a href="https://www.cs.montana.edu/paxton/classes/spring-2019/csci127/programs/program1/transcript.out"> this example output </a>

<h3> Required Python Comment </h3>
<p> Place a Python comment at the top of your Python solution that is formatted as follows </p>
<pre>
# -----------------------------------------+
# Your name                                |  &lt;-- e.g. Reese Pearsall
# CSCI 127, Program 1                      |
# Last Updated: Month Day, Year            |  &lt;-- e.g. May 5, 2021
# -----------------------------------------|
# A brief description of the assignment.   |  &lt;-- can be more than 1 line

<h2>Grading - 100 points</h2>
<ul>
<li>35 points - The GPA calculation is correct.</li>
<li>15 points - The user is prompted to enter the number of courses
    (5 points), the letter grade for each course (5 points) and 
    the credits for each course (5 points). </li>
<li>10 points - With the exception of the GPA, the output
    format matches the output format of the example output provided
    (2 points for each type of difference up to 10 points).</li>
<li>5 points - The GPA is displayed with two digits to the
    right of the decimal.</li>
<li>10 points - A function named <b>translate</b> is defined that
    takes a letter grade (e.g. b- or B-) and correctly returns its value
    (e.g. 2.7).</li>
<li>10 points - A function named <b>main</b> is defined (5 points).  
    The only python statement that does not appear in this function 
    or the translate function is the call to the main function, 
    e.g. <b>main()</b> (5 points).</li>
<li>10 points - The Python solution is easy to understand and does
    not contain unnecessary code (2 points for each
    type of improvement up to 10 points).</li>
<li>5 points - An appropriate Python comment appears at the top of 
    the submission.  See below for the type of information that
    should appear.</li> 
</ul>
