<h2>In order to complete this lab, you will need to understand</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Files </li>
	<li> ... and everything else we've talked about this semester </li>
</ul>




<h2>Background Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>The input file for this assignment, <a href="weather.csv">weather.csv</a>,
    is described on this
    <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/weather/">page</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Using <a href="program3.txt">program3.py</a> (renamed according to the
    instructions above) as a starting point,
    supply the missing functions. You will need to implement four different functions: </li>
<li>The function <b>coldest_temperature</b> should find the 
    <i>Minimum</i> temperature recorded in the file.  It should
    print this temperature, the location where it was recorded and
    the date when it was recorded.  Match the output format that appears
    in the sample transcript exactly.  Note: If the minimal temperature 
    reading occurs more than once, print out the information associated with
    its first occurrence.</li>
<li>The function <b>average_temperature</b> is passed a <i>Location</i>
    (e.g. Miles City, MT) that the user supplies.  
    The function prints the number of <i>Average</i> temperatures
    recorded for this location, as well as the average of these temperatures.
    Match the output format in the sample transcript.
    You may assume that the user enters the location in a valid
    format (e.g. city name, comma, space, state).</li>    
<li>The function <b>all_stations_by_state</b> is passed the <i>State</i> 
    (e.g. Montana) that receives reporting data from stations.
    The function finds and prints in <b>alphabetical order</b> the reporting
    stations that send their data to this state.
    Match the output format in the sample transcript.</li>
<li>Study the Weather CSV Library and develop a function of your own
    that corresponds to menu option 4.  The function should be interesting, 
    non-trivial and not a simple variation of one of the other functions. The function you create should not print out hundreds of lines of output.
    Modify the <b>menu</b> and <b>main</b> functions as appropriate.</li>
</ul> 


<h2> Sample output/transcript </h2>
<p> When your program is run, an interaction with a user could 
    produce this <a href="https://www.cs.montana.edu/paxton/classes/spring-2019/csci127/programs/program3/transcript.txt">sample transcript</a>.
</p>

<h2> Starting code </h2>
<ul>
	<li> <a href="program3.txt">program3.py</a></li>
	<li> <a href="weather.csv">weather.csv</a> </li>
</ul>


<h2> Helpful Examples </h2>
<ul>
	<li> <a href=""> book_file.py </a> </li>
</ul>


<h2>Grading - 100 points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Function <b>coldest_temperature</b>: 20 points
<ul>
<li>5 points.  The coldest temperature reading is identified correctly.  
    (All or nothing.)</li>
<li>5 points.  The location of the coldest temperature reading 
    is identified correctly.  If the coldest temperature occurs at more 
    than one location, the first location in the file should be reported.  
    (All or nothing.)</li>
<li>5 points.  The date of the coldest temperature reading is identified
    correctly.  (All or nothing.)</li>
<li>5 points.  The three lines of output match the format of the output 
    transcript exactly.  (All or nothing.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Function <b>average_temperature</b>: 20 points
<ul>
<li>5 points.  The number of readings is calculated correctly when the 
    location appears in the file, regardless of the case of the input.  
    (All of nothing.)</li>
<li>5 points.  The average temperature is calculated correctly when the 
    location appears in the file, regardless of the case of the input.  
    (All or nothing.)</li>
<li>5 points.  The two lines of output match the format of the output 
    transcript exactly when the location appears in the file.  
    (All or nothing.)</li>
<li>5 points.  The two lines of output match the format of the output 
    transcript exactly when the location does NOT appears in the file.  
    (All or nothing.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Function <b>all_stations_by_state</b>: 25 points
<ul>
<li>10 points.  The recording stations are identified correctly.
    (All or nothing.)</li>
<li>5 points.  The recording stations are printed in alphabetical order.
    (All or nothing.)</li>
<li>5 points.   The output matches the format of the output transcript
    exactly when the state appears in the file.  (All or nothing.)</li> 
<li>5 points.   The output matches the format of the output transcript
    exactly when the state does NOT appears in the file.  (All or nothing.)</li> 
</ul>
<li>Your function: 20 points
<ul>
<li>5 points.  The function is non-trivial.  (All or nothing.)</li>
<li>5 points.  The function is not a simple variation of one of the
    other three functions.  (All or nothing).</li>
<li>10 points.  The function works correctly.  (All or nothing.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Style and Quality: 15 points 
<ul>
<li>The Python solution is of high quality, properly commented, 
    and the starting code was not altered (other than the function call to your function 4) </li>
    
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
