<h2>Poker Hand Representation</h2>
<ul>
<li>A hand consists of five different cards drawn from a 52-card deck.  
    Each card contains a rank (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14) 
    and a suit ("clubs", "diamonds", "hearts" or "spades").  
    For the ranks, an 11 represents a jack, a 12 represents a queen, 
    a 13 represents a king and a 14 represents an ace.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Poker Hand Evaluation - From Best to Worst</h2>
<p>
  Note: Cards can appear in any order.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Royal Flush:</b> Contains a 10, jack, queen, king and ace, all of the
    same suit.  For example: king clubs, jack clubs, ace clubs, 10 clubs,
    queen clubs.</li>
<li><b>Straight Flush:</b> Contains five consecutive cards that share the same
    suit.  A straight flush does not contain an ace.  For example:
    3 clubs, 7 clubs, 6 clubs, 4 clubs, 5 clubs.</li>
<li><b>Four of a Kind:</b>  Contains four cards that share 
    the same rank.  For example: 4 clubs, 10 diamonds, 4 hearts, 4 spades,
    4 diamonds.</li>
<li><b>Full House:</b>  Contains three cards that share the same rank
    and two cards that share a different rank.  For example:
    jack hearts, king hearts, king clubs, jack clubs, jack diamonds.</li>
<li><b>Straight:</b>  Contains five consecutive cards that do not all share
     the same suit.  For example: 3 clubs, 7 diamonds, 6 hearts, 5 hearts,
     4 clubs.</li>  
<li><b>Three of a Kind:</b>  Contains three cards that share the same rank
    and two cards that have unique ranks.  For example: 6 clubs, 7 clubs,
    8 clubs, 7 diamonds, 7 hearts.</li>
<li><b>Two Pair:</b>  Contains two cards that share the same rank, two
    cards that share a different rank, and one card that has a unique rank.
    For example: six diamonds, six hearts, queen spades, ace clubs,
    queen diamonds.</li>
<li><b>Pair:</b>  Contains two cards that share the same rank and
    three cards that have unique ranks.  For example: king hearts,
    queen hearts, 9 diamonds, 9 hearts, ace spades.</li>
<li><b>Nothing:</b>  All other hands of five cards.  For example:
    9 hearts, 6 diamonds, 3 diamonds, 10 spades, queen clubs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="program2.txt">program2.py</a>, make sure that 
    you fully understand it, and then modify it
    so that it evaluates poker hands correctly.  When it is run using
    the hands provided, it should produce 
    <a href="https://www.cs.montana.edu/paxton/classes/csci127/programs/program2/poker.out">this output</a>.  </li>
<li>The evaluate function is correct - do not modify it.</li>
<li>If it is helpful to do so, you are welcome to introduce other
    functions into your solution.</li>
</ul> 

<h2> Hints </h2>
<ul>
	<li> Take a look at the <b>get_all_ranks() </b> function. Understand what it does.</li>
	<li> Consider thinking about how you can use <b>.count() </b> in this assingment </li>
	<li> Some functions take in the entire hand, and some functions only take in the ranks. This makes the hand analysis much easier</li>
	<li> Notice that the poker hands are sorted right away from lowest ranks to highest ranks. This will also make the hand analysis much easier </li>
	<li> Identifying a straight flush and straight will likely be the most difficult. Consider using a for loop </li>
</ul>

<h3> Required Python Comment </h3>
<p> Place a Python comment at the top of your Python solution that is formatted as follows </p>
<pre>
# -----------------------------------------+
# Your name                                |  &lt;-- e.g. Reese Pearsall
# CSCI 127, Program 2                      |
# Last Updated: Month Day, Year            |  &lt;-- e.g. December 3, 2020

# A brief description of the assignment.   |  &lt;-- can be more than 1 line

<h2>Grading - 100 points</h2>

<p>
  Note: Your program will be tested on a different set of
poker hands than the ones that appear in the main() function of
poker.py.  Thus, it is important that you test your program
on different inputs and identify the different types of poker hands
in a general fashion.
</p>

<ul>
<li>10 points - Every <b>royal flush</b> is identified correctly.  (All or nothing.)</li>
<li>5 points - Every <b>straight flush</b> is identified correctly.  (All or nothing.)</li>
<li>10 points - Every <b>four of a kind</b> is identified correctly.  (All or nothing.)</li>
<li>10 points - Every <b>full house</b> is identified correctly.  (All or nothing.)</li>
<li>10 points - Every <b>straight</b> is identified correctly.  (All or nothing.)</li>
<li>10 points - Every <b>three of a kind</b> is identified correctly.  (All or nothing.)</li>
<li>10 points - Every <b>two pair</b> is identified correctly.  (All or nothing.)</li>
<li>10 points - Every <b>pair</b> is identified correctly.  (All or nothing.)</li>
<li>10 points - Every <b>nothing</b> is identified correctly.  (All or nothing.)</li>
<li>15 points - The Python solution is properly commented, 
    easy to understand, high quality and does not contain unnecessary code. 
    (3 points for each type of improvement up to 15 points.)</li>
</ul>


<h2> More Testing Data </h2>
<p> Want to test your program with a different dataset? This helps ensure that your logic works and validates the correctness of your program. Replace your main function with this function: </p>
<pre>
def main():
    print("CSCI 127: Poker Hand Evaluation Program")
    print("---------------------------------------")

    evaluate([[14, "spades"], [10, "spades"], [8, "spades"], [2, "hearts"], [5, "spades"]])     # nothing
    evaluate([[14, "spades"], [6, "spades"], [8, "spades"], [6, "hearts"], [5, "spades"]])      # 1 pair
    evaluate([[14, "spades"], [6, "spades"], [14, "clubs"], [6, "hearts"], [5, "spades"]])      # 2 pair
    evaluate([[14, "spades"], [6, "spades"], [8, "spades"], [6, "hearts"], [6, "clubs"]])       # 3 of a kind
    evaluate([[3, "spades"], [5, "spades"], [6, "spades"], [4, "hearts"], [2, "spades"]])       # straight
    evaluate([[4, "spades"], [6, "spades"], [4, "diamonds"], [6, "hearts"], [6, "clubs"]])      # full house
    evaluate([[14, "spades"], [6, "spades"], [6, "diamonds"], [6, "hearts"], [6, "clubs"]])     # 4 of a kind
    evaluate([[13, "spades"], [11, "spades"], [12, "spades"], [9, "spades"], [10, "spades"]])   # straight flush
    evaluate([[13, "spades"], [11, "spades"], [12, "spades"], [14, "spades"], [10, "spades"]])  # royal flush

</pre>


<p> Remember to include the original main() function when you submit your program </p>
