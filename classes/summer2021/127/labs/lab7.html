<h2>In order to complete this lab, you will need to understand</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Dictionaries </li>
	<li> Files (reading and writing)
</ul>

<h2>Background Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) 
    is an older code used by computers to represent characters (such as
    the character "X") with 8 binary digits (or bits).  Here is an
    <a href="https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/references/table-of-8-bit-ascii-character-codes">ASCII table</a>. 
    Today, Unicode UTF-16, a 16 bit code is more commonly used.</li>
<li>Download <a href="lab7.txt">lab7.py</a>, rename it according to
    the instructions above, and make sure you understand it.</li>
<li>Download input file <a href="ascii-codes.csv">ascii-codes.csv</a>
    to the same directory where you downloaded <i>lab7.py</i>.
    Each line in <i>ascii-codes.csv</i> contains 8 bits (0s and 1s), 
    followed by a comma, followed by the character that the 8 bits 
    represents.  In general, the character will be of length 1
    such as the character <b>X</b>.  However,
    there are two exceptions: " " is represented by <i>space</i> 
    and "," is represented by <i>comma</i>.</li>   
</ul> 

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Take the program above and modify it by adding the <i>create_dictionary</i>
    function.  The parameter <i>file_name</i> is the name of a csv file
    that contains an unknown number of lines that reflect ASCII encodings.
    The format of this file is described in the bullet above.
    The function should return a dictionary where
    the keys are characters and the values are the 8 bit 
    representations.  Note: use " " and "," as keys instead of <i>space</i>
    and <i>comma</i>. </li>
<li>Take the program above and modify it by adding the <i>translate</i>
    function.  The parameter <i>sentence</i> consists of an unknown number
    of characters.  The parameter <i>dictionary</i> is the dictionary that was
    created by the <i>create_dictionary</i> function.  The parameter
    <i>file_name</i> is the name of the output file where all output should
    be sent.  In the output file, each character in <i>sentence</i> should
    appear on its own line, followed by a space, followed by its 8 bit
    representation.  If a character does not appear in the
    <i>dictionary</i>, the word <i>UNKNOWN</i> should appear instead of
    an 8 bit representation.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Required Output </h2>
<ul>	
<li>When the program is run,
    it should produce the following three output files:
    <a href="https://www.cs.montana.edu/paxton/classes/csci127/inlabs/lab7/output-1.txt">output-1.txt</a>,
    <a href="https://www.cs.montana.edu/paxton/classes/csci127/inlabs/lab7/output-2.txt">output-2.txt</a> and
    <a href="https://www.cs.montana.edu/paxton/classes/csci127/inlabs/lab7/output-3.txt">output-3.txt</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2> Starting Code </h2>
<ul>
	</li> <a href="lab7.txt">lab7.py</a> </li>
	<li> <a href="ascii-codes.csv">ascii-codes.csv</a> </li>
</ul>


<h2> Helpful Examples </h2>

</ul>

<h2> Required Python Comment </h2>
<p> Place a Python comment at the top of your Python solution that is formatted as follows </p>
<pre>
# -----------------------------------------+
# Your name                                |  &lt;-- e.g. Reese Pearsall
# CSCI 127, Lab 7                          |
# Last Updated: Month Day, Year            |  &lt;-- e.g. May 3, 2021
# -----------------------------------------|
# A brief description of the assignment.   |  &lt;-- can be more than 1 line 
# -----------------------------------------+

<h2>Grading - 10 points</h2>
<ul>
<li>3 points - The create_dictionary function returns a dictionary
    that contains the correct binary code for each character of length one.</li>
<li>1 point - The create_dictionary function returns a dictionary
    that contains the correct binary code for " " and ",".</li>
<li>4 points - When your program is tested with different values for
    the variable <i>sentence</i>, characters that exist in the dictionary
    are translated correctly.  For each different character that is translated 
    incorrectly, one point will be deducted.</li>
<li>1 point - When your program is tested with different values for
    the variable <i>sentence</i>, characters that do NOT exist in the dictionary
    are translated correctly to <i>UNKNOWN</i>.</li>
<li>1 point - The format of any output files created 
    match the format of the sample output files exactly.</li> 
</ul>
