<h3>Background and Directions</h3>

<h3> <b> You are NOT allowed to import any external  modules (numpy, statistics, math, etc) for this lab. Doing so will result in a major loss of points</b> </h3>

<p>
	You will be writing a program that will calculate the mean, median, and mode of some integer dataset
	<br>
	<p> Using <a href="lab4.txt"> lab4.py as a starting point </a>, define and fill in the missing functions. </p>
	<ul>
		<li> <b> calculate_mean() </b> should take in the list, calculate the mean of the dataset and print it out in  as seen in <a href = "lab4_output1.JPG"> this screenshot </a>. The mean is the average of all the numbers in the list </li>
		<li> <b> calculate_median() </b> should take in the list, calculate the median of the dataset and print it out in  as seen in <a href = "lab4_output1.JPG"> this screenshot </a>. The median is the middle value of the <b>sorted</b> integer list. If there is no definite middle value, it will be the average between the two middle values. </li>
		<li> <b> calculate_mode() </b> should take in the list, calculate the mode of the dataset and print it out in  as seen in <a href = "lab4_output1.JPG"> this screenshot </a>. The mode is the number(s) that occur the most in the list. There may be more than one mode value. You can assume that there will always be at least one mode value.</li>
		<ul>
			<li> Note: If your program can only identify one of the mode values, you will still receive full credit. 
	    </ul>
	</ul>
</p>
	
	

	
<h3> Hints </h3>

<ul>
	<li> There are lots of helpful examples that we did in lecture. Check them out below</li>
	<li> Calculating the mean should be pretty easy. For  calculating the median, the formula will change depending on whether the size of the list is even or odd. Consider checking if the size of the list is even or odd first.</li>
	<li> For calculating the mode, consider using the .count() list function discussed in lecture. If you want to go the extra mile and have your program detect all mode values, consider the strategy below:</li>
	<ul>
		<li> Create an empty list. This is the list that will contain all mode values </li>
		<li> Whenever you find a new highest mode value, empty the list and add the new value </li>
		<li> If you find a mode value that is equal to what is already in the mode value list, and the number is not already in the list, add it to the list </li>
		<li> After your for loop finished, you should have a list that contains your mode values </li>
	</ul>

</ul>



 

<h3> Sample Output </h3>
<p> When your program is run, it should look exactly like <a href="lab4_output1.JPG"> this sample output. </a>

<h3> Required Python Comment </h3>
<p> Place a Python comment at the top of your Python solution that is formatted as follows </p>
<pre>
# -----------------------------------------+
# Your name                                |  &lt;-- e.g. Reese Pearsall
# CSCI 127, Lab 4                          |
# Last Updated: Month Day, Year            |  &lt;-- e.g. May 3, 2021
# -----------------------------------------|
# A brief description of the assignment.   |  &lt;-- can be more than 1 line 
# -----------------------------------------+
</pre>
<h3>Grading (10 points) </h3>


<ul>
  <li>2 points - calculate_mean() correctly calculates and prints out the mean value</li> 
  <li>3 points - calculate_median() correctly calculates and prints out the median value </li> 
  <li>3 points - calculate_mode() correctly calculates and prints out the mode value </li>
  <li>1 point - The sample output is followed in your submission </li>
  <li>1 point - The required Python comment appears at the top of your file</li>
</ul>

<h3> Grading turnaround </h3>
<p> I will try to have your grades posted within 4 days after the submission deadline </p>
