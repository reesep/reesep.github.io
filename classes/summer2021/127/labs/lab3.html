<h3>Background and Directions</h3>
<p> You will be writing a program that will prompt the user a series of math multiplication questions. The program will keep track of how many guesses it takes in order to complete all the problems. The user must successfully answer each question correctly before moving onto the next question. Once all problems are
	solved, the program will calculate their accuracy (# of correct guesses / # of total guesses). The multiplication problems should include two random numbers between 1 and 10. 
	
	
	<br>
	<p> Using <a href="lab3.txt"> lab3.py </a> as a starting point, complete the missing function so that the program will simulate the math game described above. Other than the random numbers, your program should look almost exactly the same as the sample outputs below. 
	
<h3> Hints </h3>

<ul>
	<li> Generating random numbers is already done for you. Call the  get_random_number() function to get a random number between 1 and 10</li>
	<li> This lab will require both the use of a for loop and while loop </li>
	<li> Have an extra space somewhere? Try using string concatenation instead of printing out multiple values with commas</li>
</ul>

<h3> Helpful Examples from lecture </h3>
<ul>
	<li> <a href="https://reesep.github.io/classes/summer2021/127/lectures/examples/guessing_game.txt"> guessing_game.py </a></li>
</ul>
 

<h3> Sample Output </h3>
<p> <a href="lab3_output1.JPG"> This sample output </a> shows an example run of the program where 50% of the guesses from the user were correct.  <a href="lab3_output2.JPG"> This sample output </a> shows an example run of the program where 100% of the guesses from the user were correct.


<h3> Required Python Comment </h3>
<p> Place a Python comment at the top of your Python solution that is formatted as follows </p>
<pre>
# -----------------------------------------+
# Your name                                |  &lt;-- e.g. Reese Pearsall
# CSCI 127, Lab 3                          |
# Last Updated: Month Day, Year            |  &lt;-- e.g. May 3, 2021
# -----------------------------------------|
# A brief description of the assignment.   |  &lt;-- can be more than 1 line 
# -----------------------------------------+
</pre>
<h3>Grading (10 points) </h3>


<ul>
  <li> 2 points - play_math_game() generates X amount of random multiplication problems depending on what the user enters </li> 
  <li> 2 points - play_math_game() repeatedly asks the user for their answer until they guess correctly for each problem </li>
  <li> 3 points - play_math_game() correctly keeps track of how many total guesses have been made and calculates the total accuracy </li>
  <li> 2 points - your program matches the sample output(s) provided above (other than the random numbers generated) </li>
  <li> 1 point - the appropriate python comment appears at the top of your program </li>

</ul>

<h3> Grading turnaround </h3>
<p> I will try to have your grades posted within 4 days after the submission deadline </p>
