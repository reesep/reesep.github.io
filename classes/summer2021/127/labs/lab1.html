<h3>Background and Directions </h3>

<p>
	You will write a program that will a generate a very generic social media profile. Your program should prompt for a (1) first name, (2) last name, (3) birthday, (4) job, (5) favorite movie, and (6) favorite book. 
	The profile will also include a small ASCII art icon as a "profile picture"
</p>

<p>
	You will need to create your own ASCII art icon or <a href ="https://textart.io/art/tag/small/1"> find one on the internet </a> and put it in a box, just like this example boat ASCII art:
</p>

|               )___))___))___)                  |
|              )____)____)_____)\                |
|                 |    |    |    \               |
|            _____|____|____|_____\\__           |

|   ^^     ^^  ^ ^^^          ^^  ^^        ^^^  |

<h3> Required Output </h3>
<p> When your program is run, a short text-based profile should be printed out. It should follow a very similar output seen in <a href="lab1_output1.jpg"> this example output </a>. Here is <a href="lab1_output2.jpg">another output </a> of the same program, but with different 
    answers for the user inputs. Your program output should follow this format. Dont worry about getting the name centered perfectly</p>


<h3> Required Python Comment </h3>
<p> Place a Python comment at the top of your Python solution that is formatted as follows </p>
<pre>
# -----------------------------------------+
# Your name                                |  &lt;-- e.g. Reese Pearsall
# CSCI 127, Lab 1                          |
# Last Updated: Month Day, Year            |  &lt;-- e.g. May 3, 2021
# -----------------------------------------|
# A brief description of the assignment.   |  &lt;-- can be more than 1 line 
# -----------------------------------------+
</pre>
