<h3>Background and Directions </h3>

<p>
	You will create an ASCII picture of an unknown boat out at sea. Then, you will create a Python program that will prompt the user for (1) the name of the boat and (2) 
	the year the picture was created. Afterwards, you will display the picture as well as a caption. The caption will say "S.S." followed by the boat name, and year (see required output).
</p>

<p>
	You will need to create your own ASCII boat or <a href ="https://www.asciiart.eu/vehicles/boats"> find one on the internet </a> and put it in a box, just like the following art below:

<h3> Required Python Comment </h3>
<p> Place a Python comment at the top of your Python solution that is formatted as follows </p>
<pre>
# -----------------------------------------+
# Your name                                |  &lt;-- e.g. Reese Pearsall

  <li>4 points - An ASCII boat (that is different than the example provided) is printed out in a box </li> 
  <li>2 points - The appropriate caption is printed out at the bottom</li>
  <li>1 point - The sample output is followed in your submission </li>
  <li>1 point - The required Python comment appears at the top of your file</li>
</ul>
