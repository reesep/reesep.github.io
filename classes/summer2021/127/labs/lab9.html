<h2>In order to complete this lab, you will need to understand</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Matplotlib </li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li> There is no doubt that the housing market in Bozeman sucks right now. In this assignment, we will create a bar chart to illustrate how the median sale price of a home in Bozeman has changed over the years. The data comes from <a href="https://www.taunyafagan.com/bozeman-price-trends/"> Taynya Fagan Bozeman Real Estate </a></li>
</ul>



<h2>Assignment Directions</h2>
<ul>
<li> Download and use <a href="lab9.txt"> lab9.py </a> as a starting point. Add the missing function <b>generate_graph</b> such that it creates a bar chart showing the number of median price of homes in Bozeman from the years 2011-2021. Your graph should look exactly <a href="lab9_output.JPG"> like this </a>. Make sure you pay attention
     to the small details about the graph, such as the title, figure, labels, colors, and axis ticks. <b>NOTE:</b> The offical colors I used in the sample output are "mediumblue" and "goldenrod"</li>
<li> You should use Matplotlib to create the graph. Numpy may be used as well (although it is not required to complete this assingment). Do not import anything else</li>	 
</ul>

<h2> Starting Code </h2>
<ul>
	<li> <a href="lab9.txt">lab9.py</a></li>
</ul>

<h2> Expected Output </h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="lab9_output.JPG"> Screenshot of output </a>  NOTE: On PyCharm, you won't be able to see the figure name in the output, but you should still include a figure name in your code </li> 
</ul>

<h2>Grading - 10 points</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 points - Bar chart plots the correct information</li>
<li>1 point - The colors of the bars match the sample output.</li>
<li>1 points - The bars have a black edge</li>
<li>1 points - Y axis has the correct label</li>
<li>1 points - X axis has the correct label</li>
<li>1 points - The graph has the correct title</li>
<li>1 points - The figure name of the graph is correct</li>
<li>2 points - The ticks on the x axis are correct</li>
</ul>
