<head>Volatility Install Instructions</head>

<body>

<p> First, we will need to install some dependencies. Kali Linux should already have most of these.</p>
<ul>
    <li><tt>sudo apt install -y python3 python3-dev libpython3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-wheel</tt></li>
    <li><tt>python3 -m pip install -U distorm3 yara pycrypto pillow openpyxl ujson pytz ipython --break-system-packages</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>If you get an error, that is fine. A lot of these are additional python libraries that volatility might use, but arent actually required (I think).</p>



<p>Now, we will get the source code for volatility via GitHub. Make sure you run this command while in your home directory.</p>
<ul>
    <li><tt>git clone https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3.git</tt></li>
</ul>

<br>
You should be ready to go! You can verify things were installed correctly with:
<ul>
    <li><tt>python3 volatility3/vol.py -h</tt></li>
</ul>

</body>
