<h2>The goal of this lab is:</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Gain practice using Top-Down Dynamic Programming</li> </li>
</ul>


<h3>Directions </h3>

You will be using Dynamic Programming to calculate the Nth digit in the Fibonacci sequence. <b>You must use top-down dynamic programming, which means you will be doing recursion and maintaining a memoization table</b>.
If you are unfamiliar with the Fibonacci sequence, you should spend 5 minutes looking it up on Google. The recursion for the Fibonacci sequence can be stated using the following notation:

<br><br>

<br><br>

Due to an exponential amoung of branching, this recursive algorithm really struggles with computing Fibonacci digits past n=20. Because the Fibonacci sequence has <a href="lab10_tree.PNG">optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems </a>, it makes a great candidate for dynamic programming.
You will need to implement dynamic programming and a memoization table, so the program is able to calculate large Fibonacci digits such as n = 50, n = 80. 

<br><br>

You will download <a href="Lab10Demo.java">Lab10Demo.java</a> as a starting point, and write the <tt>fib</tt> method, which recursively computes the Nth in the digit fibonacci sequence using top-bottom dynamic programming. You are welcome to change whatever you'd like in the starting code, but it still needs to compute the 10th, 60th, and 80th fibonacci digit.
Fibonacci digits are very large. In fact, they are so large that they cannot fit inside of an <tt>int</tt> datatype, so instead you will need to use a <tt>long</tt> datatype. Your memoization table should be an array of <tt>long</tt>s, or a HashMap that maps Integers (n values) to Longs (their fibonacci digit).



<h3> Required Output </h3>

When you run your program, <a href="lab10_output.PNG">it should look exactly like this.</a>



<h3>Starting Code</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="Lab10Demo.java">Lab10Demo.java</a>.  </li>

</ul>


<h3>Grading (10 points) </h3>

<ul>
  <li>  Your program computes the 10th fibonacci digit correct- 2 points</li>
  <li>  Your program computes the 60th fibonacci digit- 3 points</li>
  <li>  Your program computes the 80th fibonacci digit- 5 points</li>
</ul>

NOTE: If your code does not compile, correctness cannot be verified, and you won't receive any points
for your code. Turn in code that compiles!
