        <h2> Takeaways </h2>    

        <ul>
	    <li> We may need to navigate the entire height of tree to insert a node --> O(h) </li>
	    <li> Breadth-First and Depth-First are two ways to navigate a tree (for searching, printing, updating, etc)</li>
	    <li> Breadth-First Search is visiting all nodes in the depth level before moving to the next depth nodes (shallow nodes are visited first) </li>
	    <li> Depth-First Search is exploring a branch as far as possible before backtracking </li>
	    <li> Both breadth-first and depth-first have to travel to every node, which results in O(n) running time</li>
	    <br>
	    <li> A binary search tree is a special type of tree where each node may only have up to 2 children ("left child" and "Right child")</li>
            <li> The left child must be less than it's parent node </li>
            <li> The right child must be greater than it's parent node </li>
            <li> To insert a node into a BST, we have to travel the entire height of the tree (new nodes are always leaf nodes)</li>
	    <li> Given n nodes, the height of the tree is O(logn) ("good tree") or O(N-1) ("bad tree") </li>
	    <li> We can use recursion to recursively process the left subtree, and then right subtree </li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Code </h2>
	January 23rd's code is a tree data structure that represents a shell that will navigate a file system on a computer using commands (cd, ls, pwd, mkdir, etc).You can download the zip, extract it, and then import project with your IDE.
	<br>
	January 30th code represents a BST that holds integers. It is important that you understand how the insert() method works. You can download the zip, extract it, and then import project with your IDE.
