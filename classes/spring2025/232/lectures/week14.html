        <h2> Takeaways </h2>    

        <ul>
	    <li> Dynamic Programming is an algorithm technique used for optimization problems that involves smartly using recursion to solve a problem with many overlapping subproblems</li>
	    <li> All DP problems require optimal substructure, and overlapping subproblems</li>
	    <li> In top-bottom DP, we remember answers of previously-solved subproblems with a memoization table</li>
	    <li> In bottom-up DP, we calculate all subproblems with a tabulation table filled with a loop</li>
	    <li> Dynamic programming is a great way to get a non-polynomial (recusrive) algorithm to polynomial time </li>

	</ul>
	
        <h2> Code </h2>
	CoinFinderDP is a dynamic programming algorithm that will find the minimum number of way to make P cents. It includes a bottom-up and top-down implementation. <br>
	EditDistanceDP is a dynamic programming algorithm that will compute the edit distance between two strings. You will need to use that code for program 4.
