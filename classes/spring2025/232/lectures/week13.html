        <h2> Takeaways </h2>    

        <ul>
	    <li> A greedy algorithm makes local greedy decision to maximize some objective function in hopes that it yields the global optimal solution.</li>
	    <li> Greedy algorithms do not always guarantee an optimal solution, and may not always be fair</li>
	    <li> Tractability refers to what problem can and cannot be solved efficiently</li>
	    <li> P is the set of all problem we can solve in polynomial time. NP is the set of problem that can be verified in polynomial time</li>
	    <li> If you provde P=NP, you can win one million dollars.</li>

	</ul>
