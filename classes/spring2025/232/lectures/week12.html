        <h2> Takeaways </h2>    

        <ul>
	    <li> Dijkstra's Algorithm will compute the shortest path from one vertex to every other vertex in the graph</li>
	    <li> Dijkstra's Algorithm works by iteratively flooding out from the starting vertex, and keep track of the current shortest paths ("best estimates") to each vertex.</li>
            <li> Dijkstra's Algorithm runs in polynomial time</li>
            <li> A* ("A star") is another shortest path algorithm that makes decisions based on a heuristic (euclidiean distance, manhattan distance, etc)</li>
	</ul>
	
        <h2> Code </h2>
	April 3rd code uses Dijkastra's algorithm to compute the shortest path of a directed weighted graph.
