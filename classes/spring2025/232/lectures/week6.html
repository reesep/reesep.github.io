        <h2> Takeaways </h2>    

        <ul>
	    <li> Collisions will always happen in hash tables, but if make a "good" hash function, we can significantly decrease the number of collisions. </li>
		<li> Use the entire key, use prime number as array size, and make sure array is big enough are ways to avoid a collision</li>
		<li> Linear probing and Seperate Chaining are ways to deal with collisions when they happen</li>
		<li> Linear probing tries to place the element at a nearby, open bucket</li>
		<li> Seperate chaining uses a list to hold multiple elements at the same bucket</li>

	</ul>

        <h2> Code </h2>
	feb18 is a basic Student database HashTable that uses seperate chaining to deal with collisions
	<br><Br>
	feb20 is some leetcode problems
