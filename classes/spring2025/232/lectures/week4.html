        <h2> Takeaways </h2>    

        <ul>
	    <li> Given n nodes, the height of the tree is O(logn) ("good tree") or O(N-1) ("bad tree") </li>
	    <li> Preorder, inorder, and Postorder are all ways to navigate a BST in O(n) time</li>
	    <li> Inserting, Removal and Searching for a value in a "good" BST is O(logn) </li>
	    <li> Inserting, Removal and Searching for a value in a "bad" BST is O(n) </li>
	    <li> We will talk about a way to guarantee a balance tree, so you can assume you always will be working with a "good" tree </li>
	    <li> If you need a dynamic data structure for an application that does many search queries, a BST is an excellent choice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Code </h2>
	January 30th code represents a BST that holds integers. It is important that you understand how the insert() method works. You can download the zip, extract it, and then import project with your IDE.
