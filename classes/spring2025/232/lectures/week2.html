        <h2> Takeaways </h2>    

        <ul>
	    <li> Lists are a dynamic, linear collection of elements</li>
	    <li> To use a List, we can use LinkedList, or ArrayList </li>
	    <li> Linked list is a collection of Nodes that point to the next Node, starting from the head node </li>
            <li> Adding something to the beginning or end of a linked list is O(1) time </li>
            <li> Removing something to the beginning or end of a linked list is O(1) time </li>
            <li> Stacks are Last In First Out data structures, and Queues are First In First Out data structures </li>
	    <li> To sort N items takes O(nlogn) time </li>
	    <br>
	    <li> A Tree is a data structure that is a collection of nodes in a hierarchy (not a linear order) </li>
	    <li> The root node is the node at the very top of the tree (trees grow down) </li>
	    <li> Each node has a parent (except the root), and each node can have children </li>
	    <li> Nodes are connected via edges, which creates a path through the tree </li>
            <li> The depth of a node is how many edges are taken to reach that node from the root </li>
	    <li> The height of a tree is the maximum depth of one of its nodes</li>	

        </ul>
