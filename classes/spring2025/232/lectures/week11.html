        <h2> Takeaways </h2>    

        <ul>
	    <li> A weighted graph is a graph where each edge has a weight/cost. The meaning of the weight depends on the application.</li>
	    <li> A minimum spanning tree is a set of connected edges from a graph that touches every vertex ("spans") with a minimum sum of edge weights </li>
	    <li> Kruskal's algorithm iteratively selects the smallest edge that does not create a cycle </li>
	    <li> Kruskals Algorithm runs in O(E log E) time.</li>
	    <li> Prim's Algorithm is another method for finding the MST</li>
	</ul>
	
        <h2> Code </h2>
