        <h2> Takeaways </h2>    

        <ul>
	    <li> Dynamic Programming is an algorithm technique used for optimization problems that involves smartly using recursion to solve a problem with many overlapping subproblems</li>
	    <li> All DP problems require optimal substructure, and overlapping subproblems</li>
	    <li> In top-bottom DP, we remember answers of previously-solved subproblems with a memoization table</li>
	    <li> In bottom-up DP, we calculate all subproblems with a tabulation table filled with a loop</li>
	    <li> Dynamic programming is a great way to get a non-polynomial (recusrive) algorithm to polynomial time </li>
	    <li> A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a directed graph with no cycles</li>

	</ul>
	
        <h2> Code </h2>

	April 24th code is a solutions for two different  DP problems (Rod Cutting, Taxi Profit). They both use top-down recursive DP.
