        <h2> Takeaways </h2>    

        <ul>
	    <li> A heap is a complete binary tree that follows the heap property. </li>
	    <li> Heap property: Parent is greater that it's children (Max heap) OR Parent is less than it's children (Min heap).</li>
	    <li> Heapify is the operation done that restructures the heap to satisify the heap property.</li>
	    <li> Heaps are typically implemented as an array.</li>
	    <li> Inserting and removing is O(logn) time.</li>
	    <li> HeapSort is a sorting algorithm that uses a heap to sort an array</li>
	    <li> Huffman Coding is a String encoding technique that uses a binary tree to generate encodings</li>
	    <li> Huffman coding is also a data compression technique (less bits are used compared to UTF or ASCII) </li>
	</ul>
