        <h2> Takeaways </h2>    

        <ul>
	    <li> A red black tree is a self-balancing BST </li>
	    <li> In a RBT, nodes are colored either "Red" or "Black". We must follow the five rules for maintaining a RBT (see slides)</li>
	    <li> If a tree is a red/black tree, we will get O(logn) insertions, removal, and searching time (much better than O(n))</li>
	    <li> If a node is inserted or removed from a RBT, rotations can be done to rebalance the tree</li>
	    <li> Managing a RBT takes O(1) time</li>

	</ul>

        <h2> Code </h2>
	February 27th code is a program that validates a red black tree (makes sure it does not violate the five rules).
