        <h2> Takeaways </h2>    

        <ul>
	    <li> A graph is a series of nodes ("Vertices") connected by edges </li>
	    <li> A graph G = ( V, E ) where V is the set of vertices, and E is the set of edges in the graph </li>
	    <li> A graph can be undirected or directed (one-way edges) </li>
	    <li> A graph can be weighted, where each edge has a cost </li>
	    <li> A path is a sequence of connected edges (no loops) </li>
	    <li> A Cycle is a sequence of connected edges that form a loop </li>
            <li> G1 = G2 iff V1 = V2 and E1 = E2</li>
	    <li> The degree of a vertex is the amount of edges that touch the vertex </li>
 	    <li> We represent graphs using an Adjancency List</li>
	    <li> Graphs can be traversed using Depth First and Breadth First. All nodes will be visited as long as there are no unconnected parts.</li>
	    <li> As we are traversing a graph, we need to keep track of which nodes have been visited to avoid infinite loops</li>
	    <li> If depth first is done on a starting vertex, depth first will find a path from the start vertex to all other vertices in the graph (not optimal paths)</li>
	</ul>
	
        <h2> Code </h2>
	March 11th code is a basic graph representation using an adjacency list. There are methods for traversing the graph and finding a path in the graph.  UndirectedGraphHashMap is a graph where Edges represent the vertices (states) that share a border.	<ul>
