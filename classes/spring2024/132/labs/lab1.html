<h1>Lab 1: Wrapping Paper Calcualtor</h1>


<h2>Due Date and Submission Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Due Date: Tuesday, January 23rd at 11:59 p.m.</li>
  <li>Partner Information: This is an individual assignment. You are allowed to collaborate with other students, but each student must submit their individual, independent solution.</li> 
  <li> Submission Instructions: Upload your solution (.java file), entitled <b>Lab1.java</b> to the BrightSpace(D2L) Lab 1 Dropbox. </li>

</ul>

<hr />

<h2>The goal of this lab is:</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Use Eclipse (or another IDE) to create a basic Java class  </li>
  <li> Print out information to the screen using <tt>System.out.println()</tt> </li>
  <li> Get basic user input using Scanner</li>
  <li> Run Java code and see output in the console </li> 
</ul>

<hr />


<h3>Background and Directions </h3>

<p>
	I am very bad at wrapping presents (<a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/ODqNmznwOS0?feature=share">proof</a>), because I never know how much wrapping paper to use. In this assignment, you will write a program that will compute the surface area of a box (a rectangle prism), so that I can determine how much wrapping paper to use. 
  <br><br>
  Given a length (l), width (w), and height (h) of a box, the surface area formula is:
  <br><br>
  <tt>
    A = 2(wl + hl + hw)
  </tt>
	
</p>

<p>
	
    You will create a Java class, named Lab1.java (make sure you check the box for <tt>public static void main(String[] args)</tt> when you create your class). In your java class, you will need to prompt the user and get the length, width, and height of the box using the Scanner. After you gather the three inputs, 
    you must compute the surface area (using the formula above), and then print out the answer to the screen.

        
</p>	

<h3> Required Output </h3>
<p> When you run your program, it should look very similar to the output seen in <a href="lab1_output.PNG"> in this screenshot </a> . 

<h3> Hints </h3>
<p> You can use .nextInt() with the Scanner to get the user input as an integer. </p>

<h3> Assumptions </h3>
<p> You can assume the user will enter a valid, non negative <b>integer</b>. </p>




<h3>Grading (10 points) </h3>


<ul>
  <li>3 points - Your program gets the length, width, and height from the user using the Scanner.</li> 
  <li>5 points - Your program correctly computes the surface area</li> 
  <li>1 point - The answer is printed out correctly</li>
  <li>1 point - Your program is named properly (Lab1.java)</li>
</ul>
