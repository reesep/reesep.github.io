<h2>Catalog Description</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Credits: 3</li>
  <li>Prerequisite: CSCI 232- Data Structures and Algorithms and (CSCI 366 Computer Systems or EELE 371 Microprocess).</li>
  <li>Description: A computer network is an ecosystem of physical links and communication protocols that allow digital communications between distant computers. Networking technologies are a foundation for distributed systems, such as the Internet, and the Web. This course will investigate the fundamentals of network system design and explore some of the emerging trends in network communications including cloud computing and wide area wireless communications.</li>
</ul>
<p> <b> Note from Reese: </b> Before taking this class, you should feel comfortable with writing programs of basic and moderature complexity in Python. You should also have a basic understanding of Git (clone, commit, add, push, pull, fetch, etc). </p>

<h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
<p>
  By the end of this course, students should be be able to: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>List the network layers and explain their function in end-to-end communications</li>
  <li>Explain the tradeoff between hop-by-hop and end-to-end network mechanisms</li>
  <li>Design and implement and networked application</li>
  <li>Analyze network traffic</li>
  <li>Measure network performance</li>
  <li>Identify and describe network performance bottlenecks</li>
  <li>Configure and troubleshoot a wide area network</li>
</ul>


<h2>Grading</h2>



40% - Programming Assignments (4 @ 10% each) <br>
20% - Labs <br>
25% - Homework <br>
15% - Final Exam <br>

<h2> Grading Breakdown </h2>
<b> Programming Assignments (30%)-  </b> There will be 4 programming assignments throughout the semester. These assignments generally take much more time to complete and involve creating a program of moderate complexity. It is highly recommended that you use Python, but you are allowed to use other programming language. If you decide to use a different language, Reese and the TA will not be able to help you debug.
Assignments will be submitted via GitHub, and you will also record a short demo of your program.
<br><br>
<b> Labs (20%)-  </b> There will be 3 labs assigned during the semester. You will use wireshark to analyze real network traffic and record your observations. Labs will be submitted to D2L as a PDF
<br><br>
<b> Homework (25%)- </b> Homeworks will test you on the theoretical concepts that we discuss during lecture. The homeworks should be relatively short and will be graded generously. You will submit your <B>typed</B> answers to D2L as a PDF 
<br><br>
<b> Final Exam (15%)- </b> There will be a final exam at the end of the semester. This will be a cummulative exam that will test you on the important topics of the class. You will also be asked to write down and document the major aspects of the OSI model from memory. You are NOT allowed any note sheet. Some exam questions will be pulled straight from the homework.
<br><br>

<h2>Grading Scale</h2>


<ul>
  <li>93+: A</li>
  <li>90+: A-</li>
  <li>87+: B+</li>
  <li>83+: B</li>
  <li>80+: B-</li>
  <li>77+: C+</li>
  <li>73+: C</li>
  <li>70+: C-</li>
  <li>67+: D+</li>
  <li>63: D</li>
  <li>60: D-</li>
</ul>

Q: Do you curve exams or final grades? <br>
A: Maybe, but probably not. If exams or final grades are lower than I anticipated, then I may apply a curve. For final grades, if you are within 1% of the next letter grade, I will bump you up.


<h2> Late Assignment Policy (IMPORTANT) </h2>
Given that most students likely have jobs and/or other fun summer plans, I want to offer some flexibility for those who may have summer plans, rigorous work schedules, or other plans. 
<br> <br>
<b> You will be given 2 virtual late passes. </b> Late passes allow you to submit an assignment up to 48 hours late with NO penalty-- no excuse required. 
<br> <br>
To use a late pass, you must indicate in your submission that you are electing to use a late pass (e.g. in a comment on your submission in D2L).
<br> <br>
Note that you cannot change this decision later. You cannot use late passes on exams and you cannot use more than one late pass on an assignment. 
<br><br>
If you do not use a late pass, the penalties for late submissions are as follows:
<ul>
	<li> < 24 hours: 25% </li>
	<li> < 48 Hours 50% </li>
	<li> > 48 hours: no credit. </li>
</ul>
<br><br>




<h2> Getting Help and Succeeding </h2>
<p> You should not wait until the last night to do a programming assignment or lab. Because this is a senior level class, you should feel comfortable with debugging your programs. Reese will not hold your hand through every single step of an assignment and I should not have to help with basic python errors. </p>



<h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>

<p>
  All students should read the 
  <a href="http://www2.montana.edu/policy/student_conduct/">MSU
  Student Conduct Code</a>.
</p>
<p> For all lab assignments and programs, you are allowed to work with one (1) partner. Exams MUST be done alone </p>


<p>
  When it comes to Python assignments, you <i> may </i> 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work with the other people on your team if teams are allowed.</li>
  <li>Share ideas with people in other teams.</li>
  <li>Help other teams troubleshoot problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You may <i>NOT</i>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share code you write with other teams.</li>
  <li>Submit code that someone on your team did not write.</li>
  <li>Modify another team's solution and claim it as your own.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Failure to abide by these rules will result in an "F"
  for the course and being reported to the Dean of Students.
</p>

<h2> Plagiarism </h2>
<p> You may not copy or modify solutions that are not your own (e.g. from the Internet, classmate, ...) for any graded material. Copying and pasting very small snippets of code is acceptable, however copying/pasting or stealing entire solutions from an external source is prohibited. I know how to use the Google and I have a Chegg membership, so If you find something, I will too! It is easy for me to tell if you copy and pasted code from the Internet, so please do not engage in such academic misconduct. If I find a student engaging in plagiarism, I will have to report you to the Dean of Students. </p>


<h2>Diversity Statement</h2>
<p>
  Montana State University's campuses are committed to providing an 
  environment that emphasizes the dignity and worth of every member of its 
  community and that is free from harassment and discrimination based upon 
  race, color, religion, national origin, creed, 
  service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), 
  veteran's status, sex, age, political ideas, marital or family status, 
  pregnancy, physical or mental disability, genetic information, gender 
  identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation.  Such an environment 
  is necessary to a healthy learning, working, and living atmosphere because 
  discrimination and harassment undermine human dignity and the positive 
  connection among all people at our University. Acts of discrimination, 
  harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, 
  stalking, and retaliation will be addressed consistent with this policy.
