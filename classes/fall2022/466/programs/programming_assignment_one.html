    <h3> Overview</h3>


    <h3> GitHub Repo Setup </h3>
    <p> You will need to setup a private github repository for all your files. You will have one GitHub repository for all assignments in this course, with each assignment getting its own specific folder. </p>
     
     Visit <a href = "https://github.com/new"> https://github.com/new</a> to create a new repository. You should name your repository <tt> <b>[last_name]-[first_name]-csci466</b></tt>. Make sure that you set your repository to be private. <b> If we find that your repository is public, you will reiceve an automatic ZERO</b>
    <br> 
    After creating your repository, go into the "settings" tab, and then click the "collaborators" tab. You will need to add both Reese and Justin and collaborators on the repository.

    <UL>
        <li> Reese's GitHub username: <b>@reesep</b> </li>
        <li> Justin's GitHub username: <b>@jdmau72</b> </li>
    </UL>
    If we do not have access to your repository, then we will be unable to grade your submission and you will recieve a zero.
