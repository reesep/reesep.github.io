										<h3>About Me</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Hello! My name is Reese Pearsall. I am a computer science graduate student at Montana State University. I am advised by <a href = "https://www.traviswpeters.com"> Dr. Travis Peters </a>. I received  my B.S. in Computer Science from Montana State university with a minor in Sociology. 
									 To see my (academic) areas of interest, please see my <a href = "https://reesep.github.io/#research"> Research Interests </a> section. I will be updating this website often to keep up-to-date with all the cool things I am doing!  </p>

									<p>
									<!--I was raised in Billings, Montana for most of my life. My father was very drawn to computers when I was growing up and because of this, my family always had a couple of Windows XP computers in the house when I was growing up. This was my first real exposure to computers and is what
									sparked my interests in computers and caused me to enroll in computer science classes in high school. To continue pursuing my interest in computers and programming, I went to Montana State University to start a degree in Computer Science during the fall semester of 2016. -->
									</p>
									<!--
									<br>
									<p>
									Despite living in Montana for most of my life, I am not much of an outdoorsman or skier (shocker, I know). Outside of school, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. I am a huge fantasy football nerd 
									and die-hard fan of the New England Patriots. 
									</p>

									<h4> 2021 Update </h4>
									<p> I am wrapping up my first year as a graduate student! I am excited (and anxious) to continue the graduate program and my thesis work. I am also teaching CSCI 127 - Joy and Beauty of Data during the Summer 2021 term. The course website and course content can be found <a href="https://reesep.github.io/classes/summer2021/127/main.html"> here </a> </p>

									<h3>Teaching</h3>
									<p>I am very passionate about teaching computer science to students of all diverse backgrounds. I have been a teaching assistant at Montana State University for over two years and I am having an absolute blast being one. I view being a teaching assistant as a privilege. I always strive to go above and beyond to help and give my students the tools and resources they need to succeed. It is always my goal to push my students to become great problem solvers and
												create excitement around some of the most fascinating ideas and core concepts in programming and computer science. I care very much about my students and their education. I make a great effort to support each and every student along the way, no matter their background. I've found that students have a much larger impact on us than we give them credit for. I have become a better teacher, communicator, and programmer after each semester working with students. Being a teaching assistant has shown me that I have a passion for
												teaching and helping others. <b> It is my goal to teach computer science at a college level after graduate school. </b> </p>
