										<h3>About Me</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Hello! My name is Reese Pearsall. I will be receiving my B.S. in Computer Science in Summer 2020 with a minor in Sociology. I will (hopefully) be starting graduate school at Montana 
									 State University in the Fall 2020. To see my (academic) areas of interest, please see my <a href = "https://reesep.github.io/#research"> Research Interests </a> section. I will be updating this website often to keep up-to-date with all the cool things I am doing!  </p>
									
									<br>
									<p> My resume can be found <a href = "files/resume.pdf"> here </a> (Last updated: December 2019)</p>
									
									<br>
									<p>
									I was raised in Billings, Montana for most of my life. My father was very drawn to computers when I was growing up and because of this, my family always had a couple of computers in the house when I was growing up.... shout out to Windows XP! This was my first real exposure to computers and is what
									sparked my interests in computers and caused me to enroll in computer science classes in high school. To continue pursuing my interest in computers and programming, I went to Montana State University to start a degree in Computer Science during the fall semester of 2016.
									</p>
									
									<br>
									<p>
									Despite living in Montana for most of my life, I am not much of an outdoorsman or skier (shocker, I know). Outside of school, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. I am a huge fantasy football nerd 
									die hard fan of the New England Patriots. I was involved in several local orchestras as a double bass player in high school, and I am still interested in music performance and playing the double bass! When I have time, I enjoy playing video games with my pals. For several years, I was the Program Director of one of the largest 
									online educational programs to help people improve in one of my favorite video games, League of Legends. 
									</p>

												<h4>Air Force</h4>
												<p>
												In the Summer of 2019, I had the privilege  to work as an intern for the Air Force. I spent 12 weeks as a <a href = "https://www.afciviliancareers.com/student-roa/" > PCIP Intern  </a> working on Hill Force Base in Utah. I spent most of the summer working with a DevOps
												development team creating an updated and modernized calibration software that tests the working condition of a (unclassified) mobile ground radar system. I gained meaningful knowledge regarding software development  lifecycles, software engineering and software testing

												<h4>TechLink</h4>
												<p>
												TechLink, located in Bozeman Montana, guides businesses in the process of evaluating and licensing cutting-edge inventions and technologies from federals research and development  labs. For about a year, I have worked as a software engineering intern in the TechLink Software Engineering and Analysis Laboratory (TSEAL). 
												Our job is to support TechLink's technology transfer effort by developing automated testing solutions for Department of Defense enterprise software. I gained experience collaborating  with other developers working with a wide variety of testing tools and libraries.

												<h4>Teaching Assistant and Smarty Cats Tutor</h4>
												<p>I have had the opportunity  to be a teaching assistant for the lower division Python classes for four semesters now. My duties include grading assignments, holding a weekly lab section holding and office hours, and helping students understand the topics taught in lecture. 
												</p>
												<br>
												<h5>
												I view being a teaching assistant as a privilege. I always strive to go above and beyond to help and give my students the tools and resources they need to succeed. It is always my goal to push my students to become great problem solvers and
												cultivate excitement around some of the most fascinating ideas and core concepts in programming, and to support each and every student along the way. I've found that students have a much larger impact on us than we give them credit for. I have become a better teacher, communicator, and programmer after each semester. Being a teaching assistant has shown me that I have a passion for
												teaching and helping others, which is why I plan on pursuing a career in undergraduate education in the future.
