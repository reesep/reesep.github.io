<h2>Catalog Description</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Credits: 3</li>
  <li>Prerequisite: CSCI 232- Data Structures and Algorithms and (CSCI 366 Computer Systems or EELE 371 Microprocess).</li>
  <li>Description: A computer network is an ecosystem of physical links and communication protocols that allow digital communications between distant computers. Networking technologies are a foundation for distributed systems, such as the Internet, and the Web. This course will investigate the fundamentals of network system design and explore some of the emerging trends in network communications including cloud computing and wide area wireless communications.</li>
</ul>
<p> <b> Note from Reese: </b> Before taking this class, you should feel comfortable with writing programs of basic and moderature complexity. You should have experience with writing C programs, basic command line navigation, and basic understanding of Git (clone, commit, add, push, pull, fetch, etc). </p>

<h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
<p>
  By the end of this course, students should be be able to: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>List the network layers and explain their function in end-to-end communications</li>
  <li>Explain the tradeoff between hop-by-hop and end-to-end network mechanisms</li>
  <li>Design and implement and networked application</li>
  <li>Analyze network traffic</li>
  <li>Measure network performance</li>
  <li>Identify and describe network performance bottlenecks</li>
  <li>Configure and troubleshoot a wide area network</li>
</ul>


<h2>Grading</h2>



40% - Programming Assignments (5 @ 8% each) <br>
20% - Labs <br>
25% - Homework <br>
15% - Final Exam <br>

<h2> Grading Breakdown </h2>
<b> Exams (30%)-  </b> There will be two exams given during the summer semester. The exams will consist of multiple choice and short programming problems. The exams will be completely online and you will have ~12 hours to complete it. Practice exams will be provided to help you study.
You CAN use your computer, the textbook, and any notes you have on the exam. You CANNOT use search engines to access external resources (stackoverflow, w3schools, youtube, etc)
<br><br>
<b> Labs (25%)-  </b> There will be roughly two labs each week (see course schedule for lab dates and times). 
The labs allow you to get experience with the topics taught in class. These programming assignments are typically shorter, and should only take 1-2 hours to complete. 
Labs are due on the day of the lab at 11:59 P.M. Labs will be posted a day or two ahead of time for those that want to get started early.
<br><br>
<b> Programs (30%)- </b> Programs are more lengthy programming assignments that are to be done outside of class. There are 5 programs assigned throughout the semester and are due on their specified due date (usually Sundays) at 11:59 PM.
 You are given ~1 week to complete the programs. These assingments are much more higher stakes, so it is important you get started on them early and get help if needed. There will be optional program help sessions during my office hours on Friday.
<br><br>
<b> Watching online lectures (10%)- </b> It will be expected that you watch each of the lectures that is posted throughout the summer. At the end of the semester, I will go through all the lectures and verify who watched the lectures. I am able to see who watched the lectures and how much of the lecture you watched. If you watch all the lectures, you will get an easy 10% of your grade. I would recommend watching the lectures at 1.25 -1.5x speed if you think the lectures are too brutal to watch :-)
<br><br>
<b> 1 on 1 Meetings w/ Reese (5%)-  </b> You will be required to meet with me via Zoom (outside of office hours) at least once during the semester. You will sign up for a time to meet with me. 
This meeting is mostly just a check-in to make sure you are doing ok with a class and give you some 1 on 1 support if you need it. Meeting times will be available to sign up for during weeks 2, 3, 4, and 5.
<br><br>

<h2>Grading Scale</h2>


<ul>
  <li>93+: A</li>
  <li>90+: A-</li>
  <li>87+: B+</li>
  <li>83+: B</li>
  <li>80+: B-</li>
  <li>77+: C+</li>
  <li>73+: C</li>
  <li>70+: C-</li>
  <li>67+: D+</li>
  <li>63: D</li>
  <li>60: D-</li>
</ul>

Q: Do you curve exams or final grades? <br>
A: Maybe, but probably not. If exams or final grades are lower than I anticipated, then I may apply a curve. For final grades, if you are within 1% of the next letter grade, I will bump you up.


<h2> Late Assignment Policy (IMPORTANT) </h2>
Given that most students likely have jobs and/or other fun summer plans, I want to offer some flexibility for those who may have summer plans, rigorous work schedules, or other plans. 
<br> <br>
<b> You will be given 2 virtual late passes. </b> Late passes allow you to submit an assignment up to 48 hours late with NO penalty-- no excuse required. 
<br> <br>
To use a late pass, you must indicate in your submission that you are electing to use a late pass (e.g. in a comment on your submission in D2L).
<br> <br>
Note that you cannot change this decision later. You cannot use late passes on exams and you cannot use more than one late pass on an assignment. 
<br><br>
If you do not use a late pass, the penalties for late submissions are as follows:
<ul>
	<li> < 24 hours: 25% </li>
	<li> < 48 Hours 50% </li>
	<li> > 48 hours: no credit. </li>
</ul>
<br><br>




<h2> Getting Help and Succeeding </h2>
<p> It is very easy to fall behind in this class (especially during these quick 6 week classes). This course IS NOT a good class to slack off/mentally check out in and it is NOT nice to people that don't ask for help if they need it. I don't want you to dedicate your entire summer break to this course, but you should expect to put in a couple of hours each day into the course. If you find yourself struggling or stuck on assignment, you should seek help SOONER rather than later. I am not trying to scare you, but rather to warn you about issues I've seen in the past :-) I will always make myself accessible for help and I am super dedicated to helping you succeed in the course. I will respond to emails as soon as I can (you can usually count on a response back within 5 hours). If you email for help on an assignment, you should attach your python file (.py file) to the email so I can access it on my end. </p>



<h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>

<p>
  All students should read the 
  <a href="http://www2.montana.edu/policy/student_conduct/">MSU
  Student Conduct Code</a>.
</p>
<p> For all lab assignments and programs, you are allowed to work with one (1) partner. Exams MUST be done alone </p>


<p>
  When it comes to Python assignments, you <i> may </i> 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work with the other people on your team if teams are allowed.</li>
  <li>Share ideas with people in other teams.</li>
  <li>Help other teams troubleshoot problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You may <i>NOT</i>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share code you write with other teams.</li>
  <li>Submit code that someone on your team did not write.</li>
  <li>Modify another team's solution and claim it as your own.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Failure to abide by these rules will result in an "F"
  for the course and being reported to the Dean of Students.
</p>

<h2> Plagiarism </h2>
<p> You may not copy or modify solutions that are not your own (e.g. from the Internet, classmate, ...) for any graded material. Copying and pasting very small snippets of code is acceptable, however copying/pasting or stealing entire solutions from an external source is prohibited. I know how to use the Google and I have a Chegg membership, so If you find something, I will too! It is easy for me to tell if you copy and pasted code from the Internet, so please do not engage in such academic misconduct. If I find a student engaging in plagiarism, I will have to report you to the Dean of Students. </p>


<h2>Diversity Statement</h2>
<p>
  Montana State University's campuses are committed to providing an 
  environment that emphasizes the dignity and worth of every member of its 
  community and that is free from harassment and discrimination based upon 
  race, color, religion, national origin, creed, 
  service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), 
  veteran's status, sex, age, political ideas, marital or family status, 
  pregnancy, physical or mental disability, genetic information, gender 
  identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation.  Such an environment 
  is necessary to a healthy learning, working, and living atmosphere because 
  discrimination and harassment undermine human dignity and the positive 
  connection among all people at our University. Acts of discrimination, 
  harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, 
  stalking, and retaliation will be addressed consistent with this policy. 
</p>
